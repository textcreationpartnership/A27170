            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough with great zeal and prudence, you uſe all the power which your Birth and Dignities have given you, for the defence of the true Chriſtian Religion, as it is amongſt us profeſſed, and eſtabliſhed: yet I hope this ſhort account of what
<pb facs="tcp:52252:3"/>is moſt contrary and moſt deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to it, will not diſpleaſe you. I know your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> underſtands what is here treated of far better than I do, but ſo doth not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People: they may receive information from theſe Papers, and will likely do it the more freely, if you ſhall permit them to go abroad under your Name; For it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged that we owe much of our preſervation to your Care and Chriſtian Courage: and that you did ſtand in the gap, when our Enemies were preſſing to come in upon us.</p>
            <p>My Lord, the watchfulneſs and labours of your Sacred <hi>Order,</hi> to preſerve the face of a Church, and as much Order and Diſcipline among us, as the iniquity of the times can permit, is a greater ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Proteſtant Intereſt
<pb facs="tcp:52252:3"/>than many are apt to believe: For our Adverſaries expect not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but by breaking of us, and diſſolving thoſe bonds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which keep us united: well knowing that thoſe ſheep are an eaſie prey, when ſcattered abroad, which under the guidance of their proper Paſtors are ſafe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable.</p>
            <p>I have therefore endeavoured by what I have ſaid of the Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cruelties of <hi>Rome,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade ſuch as are averſe to them, that their duty and intereſt oblige them to joyn with our Church: which profeſſing nothing but the pure and Primitive Religion of our bleſſed Redeemer, makes uſe of none of thoſe bloudy and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Methods, wherewith the Papal Religion and Authority, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: and whoſe dangers and
<pb facs="tcp:52252:4"/>perſecutions on both hands, are for the beſt Cauſe in the world, even for her faithful Allegeance to God and the King.</p>
            <p>I ſhall rejoyce, if what I have deſigned for the common good, be beneficial to any. And if the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offer I make of it to your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> be favourably accepted. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall ever pray for the peace and proſperity of our <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And that God would long preſerve you, to advance his glory, and be an Ornament and Support to this Church: Remaining,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cannot but grieve every Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of peace, that is, every good man to ſee our diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. We fear many things, and have reaſon to fear yet many more; eſpecially when we conſider how grievouſly God is provoked to bring upon us the worſt of evils. I deſign not to repreſent thoſe crying ſins that call for deſtroying vengeance upon us, or to make declamations againſt them: but it is for my purpoſe to note, that the deforming a moſt pure and pious Reformation; and the diſturbing and weakening an equitable and happy frame of Government, doth not only call for ruin, but actually brings it; breaks down the fence of our ſafety, and ſo makes way for thoſe Erroneous and Tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical impoſitions we fear and foreſee.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52252:5"/>
            <p>There is cauſe enough to believe, that the Romiſh Party hath all along, ſince the Reformation, and doth ſtill continue to widen our breaches, and to foment our diviſions; there are many inſtances of it related by ſeveral credible Witneſſes, and ſome of them ſworn too: but that which moſt of all confirms it, is, that it is much their intereſt to keep us from ever having a happy, peaceable, and well-ſetled Church, a conſtant and beautiful Order amongſt us: and that they certainly will not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e and burn, had they power ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Some of our Seperatiſts are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded, and have ſo poor an intereſt in the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rld, that they muſt of neceſſity yield and fall, were they not ſupported by the power and policy of a ſtronger Party: and the moderate ſort of them are ſo near us, that we could not but joyn and unite together, were it not for their interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe great concern it is to keep us aſunder, that they may have room to come in, at the void, urguarded ſpace betwixt both.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52252:5"/>
            <p>Whether or no it ſhall ſucceed as they would, God alone knows; they have great hopes, and we cannot but have a dread upon us: but however by breaking us to pieces, they revenge our breaking of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them; and they likely tempt ſome to believe, that we ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the ſame grounds, as the Separatiſts have, to leave the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They will now and then draw a parellel betwixt both Caſes, and confidently aſſert that we can urge nothing againſt our Schiſmatick, but what they may urge with as much reaſon againſt our Reformers.</p>
            <p>It is no ſmall advantage to their Cauſe, if they can work in Diſſenters as great an abhorrence for our Liturgy and Divine Service, as for the Latin Maſs: and ſo bring them to an indifference, as though there were hardly any choice betwixt both. This will leſſen the Odium under which they lie, deriving part of it upon our Church, and withal is a preity ſure way to bring men bach again to <hi>Rome.</hi> So that if I were a Jeſuit, I would, as <hi>Lewis Moulin,</hi> and ſome ſuch as he, ſo cry out upon the Superſtitions, bloudy Perſecutions, and Idolatries of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:52252:6"/>by that means drive men ſo far from it, that when things tend towards a change, the people might either be undetermined what Party to take, or even prefer Popery to ſo deform a Reformation, as they ſhould believe ours to be. And accordingly it is eaſie to obſerve, that thoſe Sectaries are not far from <hi>Rome,</hi> which are fartheſt from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jeſuits Schools abroad, are full of our Youth, in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Seminaries are perpetually fitting up young men to carry on the great work of reducing this potent Iſland to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Once every year they are ſent over in numerous Sholes from thoſe Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not directly and openly to preach Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, (they are too wiſe to go that way to work) but by other means to promote its reſtauration; acting ſuch parts bare-faced or in a diſguiſe, as they are enabled by their Genius and intereſt; ſuch to be ſure, as ſhall conduce to the diſturbance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that Church and Government, which now keeps them out.</p>
            <p>Hence, I make no queſtion, proceeds the beginning, or the continuance of our diviſions; and the frequent inſulting over
<pb facs="tcp:52252:6"/>us upon this account, and upbraiding us with our many Sects, ſhews that Romi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts are not a little proud of their ſucceſs in begetting or maintaining of them. A man in a Vizard robs his Neighbour, and having pulled it off, reproacheth him for his beggarlineſs: this is very diſingenuous. But very ſtrange it is, that the ſame man ſhould yield himſelf a prey, every time the Thief ſhall put on his mask.</p>
            <p>The miſchief is, that Faction, not Conſcience, makes the great differences in the Chriſtian Church. Opinions are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and aſſerted, upon deſign, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote worldly intereſts. Thoſe Doctrines in the Romiſh Church we ſay and prove to be Innovations, are ſuch as tend to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the power and greatneſs of thoſe that brought them in, and now impoſe them on others. And it is not to be denied, but that ſome are enemies to the Tyranny of that Church, becauſe they themſelves would govern, or be under no Government at all. Factions, like errors and ſins may claſh and fight one againſt another: but it is not the property of true Religion to multiply Controverſies, or to be fierce in leſſer contentions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52252:7"/>
            <p>But then there are ſome things ſo bad in themſelves, ſo much againſt Divine Commandments, and the duty every man ows to God, that there he may not, and muſt not comply. Let who will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn what is diſhonourable to God, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by him, the firſt and greateſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation ought to take place, God muſt be obeyed above all, though in the diſcharge of that obedience we expoſe our ſelves to great dangers and ſufferings. Glad ſhould I be that Popery were the true Religion, that our Bleſſed Lord had conſtituted the Pope his Vicar, and made him infallible, and commanded us to believe and obey all he ſhould ſpeak from his Chair. It would ſuperſede all our enquiries, and the pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s we are at, to examine whether Papal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees agree well with our Maſters w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll; It would have ſpared the bloud of Millions of Chriſtians, who rather choſe to die in flames and tortures, than comply with thoſe Injunctions which they judged contrary to their Saviours Laws. And it would free all meek good men, (who would buy peace, and ſubmit to any thing that were not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) from the dread of Maſſacres and Inquiſitions, and what elſe may be feared from the formidable Principles and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52252:7"/>
            <p>We are abundantly ſatisfied that the Biſhop of that City hath no juſt right to that Power and Dominion he claims over all Crowns and Miters; nay, we clearly ſee by the Records of ancient times, that every where he uſed very ill means to uſurp that Authority. Yet I believe moſt Proteſtants would eaſily be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from their right, and for peace ſake to give him more than is his due. Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, Honour, even Money to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Greatneſs, I could afford him, if that engaged me to nothing contrary to the duty I owe my God and Saviour: But if yielding ſo far, muſt oblige me to embrace a new Creed and falſe, and to practice an unlawful Worſhip, then I am bound to aſſert my liberty, und to bear faith and allegiance to God, whatever I ſuffer for it; we might if we would part with our freedom, but we may not give up Gods truth and honour.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is this; we may not live in the Communion of <hi>Rome</hi> but as the Popes Subjects, and that would make us in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things rebels againſt God. We are not obliged to live in that Communion, and we dare not do it, for then, except we yield in all things, we are proceeded
<pb facs="tcp:52252:8"/>againſt as Hereticks, as accurſed Traitors to God and the Pope, and the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities are inflicted on us. So that, as we would preſerve our Conſciences and our lives, we muſt withdraw from <hi>Rome,</hi> and live aſunder. All Chriſtians are obliged to worſhip God alone, and in all things to obey their Saviour; and all men would live and enjoy their own. Now I ſhall make it appear that if we are in the Communion, or in the power of the Roman Church, we can do neither. We muſt believe and worſhip otherwiſe than Gods Word hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or we muſt live under infamy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and expire in flames.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I give an account of theſe two things, it will appear that there is a very great difference betwixt the caſe of the Reformation, and the caſe of them that ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> That, as neceſſary and Juſt as that was, this is as needleſs and unjuſt: and that, as much as Religion and ſelf-preſervation obligeth us to break communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo much the ſame bonds tie all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters to unite with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to live quietly, like good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiane, and loyal Subjects, in its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

               <p>I Shall not in this place repreſent how diſtant from all cruelties, how averſe to them is the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: But firſt I ſhall give ſome account of thoſe Doctrines and that Worſhip, peculiar to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which for being oppoſed, or not received, in whole or in part, have oceaſioned thoſe perſecutions of which we complain. I ſhall begin with the Doctrines as they are contained in the New Creed of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. who, as was appointed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> framed and impoſed a Profeſſion, or Confeſſion of Faith to be taken as an Oath by all the Secular Clergy, by all Military Orders, by all ſorts of Friers, all that ſhould be required, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52252:11"/>all that ſhould come to their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in this wiſe:</p>

                  <hi>Credo in unum Deum patrem omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>I <hi>N.</hi> ſtedfaſtly believe and profeſs all things contained in that Confeſſion of Faith which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the holy Roman Church, as follows: I believe in one God the Father Almighty,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed thoroughout; and then follow the new Articles of the Roman Faith.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>I moſt ſtedfaſtly embrace and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Apoſtolical and Eccleſiaſtical Traditions, with the Conſtitutions, and all other things uſed in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52252:11"/>
                  <p>I alſo receive the holy Scriptures according to that ſenſe, which our holy Mother the Church (whoſe it is to interpret it) hath held, and ſtill holds, neither will I ever underſtand or explain otherwiſe than according to the unanimous conſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>I alſo profeſs that there are ſeven true and proper Sacraments of the New Covenant, inſtituted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, neceſſary to mens ſalvation, (though not each Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every ſingular perſon.) Theſe are Baptiſm, Confirmation, the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, Peance, Extreme Unction, Orders, and Matrimony, all which do confer grace, and whereof Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Confirmation, and Orders; cannot be repeated without Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>I likewiſe own and admit all the approved and cuſtomary Rites which the Catholick Church uſeth in the ſolemn adminiſtration of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>All and every particular defined and declared by the moſt holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> about Juſtification and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52252:12"/>original ſin, I receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe I profeſs that in the Maſs a true and proper propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the living and the dead, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God, and that in the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament of the Euchariſt, there is really and ſubſtantially the Body and Bloud, with the ſoul and divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that there is a converſion made of the whole ſubſtance of the Bread into his Body, and of the whole ſubſtance of the Wine into his Bloud, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion the Catholick Church calls Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                  <p>I alſo confeſs that under either kind or ſpecies, whole Chriſt is entirely contained, and the true Sacrament received.</p>
                  <p>I conſtantly hold that there is a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and that the Souls therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained are helpt by the good Works and Prayers of the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>As alſo that the Saints which reign with Chriſt pray for us, and are to be worſhiped and prayed to, and their Reliques to be venerated.</p>
                  <p>I moſt firmly aſſert that the Images
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52252:12"/>of Chriſt, of the Bleſſed Virgin, and of the other Saints are to be had and retained, and that due honour and worſhip is to be imparted to them.</p>
                  <p>Alſo I affirm that the power of granting Indulgences, was left by Chriſt to his Church, and that the uſe of them is moſt ſalutary to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge that the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Apoſtolick and Roman Church is the Mother and Miſtris of all Churches, and I promiſe and ſwear true obedience to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is Chriſts Vicar, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>I alſo without doubt or ſcruple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and profeſs all other things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, defined, and declared by the ſacred Canons, and General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, eſpecially by the moſt holy Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them, with all hereſies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever condemned, rejected, and curſed by the Church, I likewiſe reject, and condemn, and curſe.</p>
                  <p>This holy Catholick Faith which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52252:13"/>I now truly hold and profeſs, and without which no man can be ſaved, I ſhall (by Gods help) conſtantly keep and confeſs, whole and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, untill my laſt breath, and to the utmoſt of my power ſhall in my Place and Calling endeavour that the ſame ſhall be taught, preached, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by all my Subjects, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my care.

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>General Reflections on this Roman Creed.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT ſeems they that framed and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe new Articles, were afraid they ſhould not hold faſt enough the Conſciences of men, and therefore Pope <hi>Pius</hi> obliged them to ſwear; a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Profeſſion would not be ſufficient to enſlave the Minds of Chriſtians, and bind upon them this heavy Burthen, a formal Oath, as we ſee is contrived, and ſo the Bull calls it, <hi>forma juramenti.</hi> And whereas men make Confeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith freely and out of choice, as that that will be infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to them: They muſt ſwear to the Roman Faith to ſecure themſelves from perſecution.</p>
                  <p>I know that ſome of the opinions of this Roman Creed were preſt before upon the Weſtern World by Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fire and Sword, and that moſt of them had been gaining ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſecuted oppoſers, about five or ſix hundred years: But they never became a Creed impoſed with an Oath,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52252:14"/>neceſſary to all mens ſalvation, till this Council and Pope did make them ſo. And we find about the beginning of this Council under <hi>Paul</hi> III. in the year 1546. that when the Fathers made profeſſion of their Faith, according to the Roman Creed as they call it. <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum quo ſancta Romana Eccleſia utitur. Seſſ.</hi> 3. that they ſaid nothing but the <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed, this new one not being yet hatcht. Nay, even now in their publick Worſhip, and when they Baptize (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the Novelty of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Faith) they only uſe the three Catholick Creeds; the new one is not mentioned, but reſerved to perſecute Hereticks withall, that is to damn and to deſtroy the Enemies of the might and grandeur of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is to be noted, that all theſe New Articles are ſo contrived that they all manifeſtly make for the advantage of the Roman Church. They eſtabliſh its uncontrolable dominion over Mens Conſciences; they ſtretch and aſſert its power over all perſons and in all caſes; and they bring great profit to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Clergy. Here you find nothing that glorifies any of Gods Attributes;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52252:14"/>nothing to magnifie or explain the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our Redemption; nothing that can engage men to ſerve and love God better; nothing to encreaſe the hopes or ſettle the peace of Chriſtian ſouls: All of it is nothing but the founding of the Roman Empire, the Canonizing of thoſe Means whereby the Pope and his Clergy ſhould reign and abound in wealth.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly this Faith is not propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated or maintained (as the Chriſtian was) by the humility, meekneſs, and patient ſufferings of its Preachers and Profeſſors, but by craft and policy, by might and violence. Not by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of a a divine power in the working of Wonders and Miracles openly before all the world: But by ſuch pretended feats, as many among themſelves are aſhamed to mention and to own. Theſe 500 years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they have filled their Books with wondrous Stories to back thoſe their new devices which are neither Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nor univerſally received, neither contained in Scripture, nor the ancient Creeds. And theſe their Miracles are for the moſt part ſo ill contrived, ſo abſurd,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52252:15"/>ſo private and obſcure, ſo ill atteſted, that they confute themſelves, and prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ungroundedneſs of thoſe Doctrines, and badneſs of that Cauſe whoſe intereſt they are brought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THis Creed is the unpaſſable Gulf fixt betwixt Popery and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and hath widened the breach, never to be made up, betwixt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church and all other Chriſtian Churches. It is not now, as before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when many lived in the Roman Church, hoping and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to rectifie what was amiſs, and without owning its errors; Now thoſe errors are become Articles of faith, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red neceſſary to all mens ſalvation, and men muſt make a publick profeſſion of them, and ſolemnly ſwear to them. And it is become a common Maxim, and a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple on which they ground their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt Diſſenters. <hi>Dubius in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52252:15"/>fide cenſetur haereticus,</hi> that <hi>he is counted an heretick that doubts in matters of Faith.</hi> You may not queſtion; not ſo much as heſitate about any Point in the New Articles; neither may you inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them, or ſeek to give them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious ſenſe, as the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> hath endeavoured to do, to make them plauſible; the whole Creed and Oath muſt go down, in the Popes ſenſe that impoſed it, be it what it will. So that except a man truly and thoroughly can believe all this, he cannot, with any Conſcience, any ways comply with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or remain in its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: And all the guilded words and promiſes of the Popiſh Clergy to them they would ſeduce about tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting different opinions, and leaving them to themſelves; are (as appears by this Bull and Creed) but pious Frauds, and down-right lies.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe New Articles of Faith is grounded the Worſhip now uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Whoever believes them not, muſt needs look on the Maſs and other Popiſh devotions with great horrour and abhorrency, and own it his duty to die, rather than joyn with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52252:16"/>them in what is ſo contrary to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſo diſhonourable to his God and Saviour. So that the Points of this New Creed are the touch-ſtone and trial of a Papiſt, and ſtand as a Partition-wall betwixt him and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant. Whence I deſire it may be conſidered, how unjuſt and injurious they are to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and its Conformable Clergy, that charge It and Them with being Popiſh, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected. Some, no doubt, (as we have ſeen by experience) do it with evil deſigns, and will do it in ſpight of all evidence to the contrary; and to them nothing is to be ſaid, but God convert them. Others that may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, will perhaps be ſatisfied when they conſider, 1. The conſtancy of our Clergy in profeſſing that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Doctrine for which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers died Martyrs, even in thoſe days when they themſelves were perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, exiled, and ruined for it, and had all the provocations imaginable to paſs over to <hi>Rome,</hi> if they had had any inclination towards it. 2. Or when they acquaint themſelves with the many and moſt learned Writings of our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52252:16"/>Doctors of all Ranks, againſt Romiſh Errors and Superſtitions, ſo ſtrong, ſo convincing, that none can read them with any attention, and remain unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in any Point wherein Proteſtants do differ from <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. Or laſtly, If they will but compare the declared and avowed Doctrines of our Church, as they are contained in the Common-Prayer-Book, and the 39 Articles, with either the Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or in ſhort with this Roman Creed. For then they ſhall ſee, not only, that we hold none of theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, peculiar to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and contrary to Gods word: But that our Doctrines and Perſwaſions are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſed to them.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe that make Popery to conſiſt in two or three Ceremonies or indifferent Rites, they much miſtake the matter; and they muſt be mightily in love with Ignorance and Scruples, that cheriſh ſuch thoughts, and will not read what will inform them better. Any Reformed Church might as well be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with what any man ſhall pleaſe, for ſome of their Cuſtoms and Orders will be found to reſemble thoſe of the Jews,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52252:17"/>Pagans, Mahometans, or Socinians. And where the differences are ſo many, ſo great, ſo juſt, and material, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is ſtrangely unreaſonable to expect that we ſhould go naked, or walk upon our heads, for fear of doing any thing that the Papiſts do.</p>
                  <p>It is much more to be feared leſt the want of Order and Decency, of Creeds and Forms of Divine Worſhip, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Holy Sacraments, ſhould open an eaſie entrance for the Roman Innovations to come in, where there is a great confuſion, and a great latitude, and nothing fixt and eſtabliſht in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to them, than that we, who in the Conformity of our Confeſſions of Faith, and of a pure and holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God alone through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hold a conſtant and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Communion with all Reformed Churches, and all Chriſtians that keep to the Primitive Rules, ſhould break our ties, and break over thoſe bars and incloſures wherewith we have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated our ſelves from Popery, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it from mixing with us.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52252:17"/>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> hath not made any thing neceſſary to Salvation, but what God hath declared ſo to be, and hath impoſed upon the People no controverted or doubtful Doctrines, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what all true Chriſtians own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all places, and all times, ſo that it hath given provocation to none, but to ſuch as own the New Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. to ſeparate from her Communion: But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made to be Faith abſolutely neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that which was not ſo before, that which God no where revealed in his holy Word, and that which is in many things contrary to it, and to the true Catholick ſaith of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>And who that believes Jeſus Chriſt to be that Great Prophet who revealed to us the whole Counſel of God, and is alone to be heard as the only Author and finiſher of our Faith, can ſwear an indefinite obedience to the Pope, and make it part of his belief <hi>that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth all the Traditions of the Church of</hi> Rome, (which they themſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not number) <hi>and receives all the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and declarations of her Councils,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52252:18"/>eſpecially that of</hi> Trent, <hi>and believes her to be the Mother and Miſtris of all Churches,</hi> which is apparently falſe? Who that believes them accurſed that ſhall add any thing to that Faith which our Bleſſed Lord and his Apoſtles preached, can now make part of it, <hi>that Chriſt is truly ſacrificed in the Maſs for the Living and the Dead; that he is wholly contained under either ſpecies in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that there is a Purgatory, where Souls are relieved by what the Living do here for them; That the Saints muſt be prayed to, and that due Worſhip muſt be given to their Relicks and Images; and that Chriſt left to his Church a power of granting ſalutary indulgences to ſuch as would purchaſe them, as we ſee by their practice?</hi> This is a Faith ſo new, ſo ſtrange, ſo different from the Chriſtian, ſo contrary to it, that any man that ſhall compare both, and be perſuaded, that it is part of that higheſt honour which belongs to God alone, that all his Dictates and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be received with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubmiſſion of our underſtanding, and an entire faith, will die (as Millions have) rather than make profeſſion of this Roman Creed, Joh. 2.9. <hi>Whoſoever
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52252:18"/>tranſgreſſeth,</hi> (or goeth beyond) <hi>and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God.</hi> The Doctrine of Chriſt we have in the Goſpel, of which the ſum is contained in the Chriſtian Creed. It declares the glorious Attributes of God, his wonderful works of power and mercy; what great things he hath done for us, what more he will have us to expect from him; and all to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us Religiouſly to ſerve and love him alone, and own him for our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord by an holy Worſhip and Obedience. The Doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> doth only ſet forth the unlimited power and dominion of the Pope and his Church over the ſouls and conſciences of men, and the means of ſeizing on their Wealth, by ſelling the Maſs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and the indulgences, by taking the Offerings of the Images and Shrines, and drawing Souls out of Purgatory. <hi>The Popes Crown and the Monks Belly</hi> is the ſum of all, and the crime of us Hereticks is the ſpeaking againſt either, or the not believing what makes for them, as much as we believe in God.</p>
                  <p>For this were the Cruelties and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of the Roman Church
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52252:19"/>invented, and exerciſed againſt all Chriſtians, whoſe knowledge and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would not permit them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this new and unchriſtian Faith: But from this it is apparent we diſſent, not out of peeviſhneſs or humour, or a ſtubborn temper, but upon the account of obligations and duty to our God and Saviour, whoſe true Religion (I hope) we ſhall conſtantly own and profeſs, whatever we ſuffer for it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of ſeveral parts of the Roman Worſhip, and firſt of their Exorciſms.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is not to be expected that where the Doctrines are ſo corrupted the Worſhip ſhould be pure; Mens Actions commonly are worſe than their Principles; and ſo here it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that thoſe Articles of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creed on which is grounded any part of their Worſhip, are not ſo bad in the Notion as they are in the Practice. Their cuſtoms, uſages, and outward
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52252:19"/>Acts of Religion which are the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of their Doctrines, make them uncapable of thoſe fine Gloſſes ſome of their Miſſionaries would put upon them, and withal are ſo ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, ſo idolatrous, that all men that fear God, and are concerned for the honour of the Bleſſed Jeſus muſt needs judge themſelves abſolutely obliged, rather to die, than to joyn and comply with the Popiſh Worſhip.</p>
               <p>As far indeed as their Worſhip pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from that Chriſtian Faith they have common with us, the Apoſtles Creed, they may have Prayers very good, and very devout: But as far as it proceeds from their new Roman Faith, it is a ſtrange Medley of conjuring, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating, abuſing Gods holy Name, and giving to Creatures the love and praiſes due to our Bleſſed Redeemer.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give ſome inſtances of it, and firſt begin with their conjuring,
<note place="margin">Part. 1. chap. 2. ſect. 10.</note> of which they have <hi>Treaſures</hi> and <hi>Manuals</hi> Printed, beſides what is in their <hi>Rituals,</hi> and other Books of publick uſe. Of the firſt, Biſhop <hi>Tailor</hi> in his diſſuaſive from Popery gives us ſome account how they aſſault the Devil with Holy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52252:20"/>Water, Incenſe, Sulphur, Rue, little Papers containing holy words, Relicks of Saints, and notable Railing. How the Prieſt with his Stole about the Neck of the Poſſeſſed very imperiouſly commands the Devil, uſing many names of God Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, very many ſigns of the Croſs, adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the name of St. <hi>Ann,</hi> St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, all whoſe Names, Epithets, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Titles, are very effectual; the Form in the Ritual is not much better, and all of it is a heap of things very abſurd, and very diſhonourable to true Religion.</p>
               <p>But in their daily Miniſtrations, there are ſo many of theſe Exorciſms for to drive out Devils out of every thing, that one would think they are <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> who believed moſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to belong to thoſe evil Spirits. In the Office for Baptiſm they Exorciſe the Salt which they put into the Infants mouth, with nine ſigns of the Croſs and a Prayer whereby they beg it may become <hi>Salutare Sacramentum, a ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Sacrament, and a perfect Medicine</hi> to all that receive it. And even the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52252:20"/>Child is Exorciſed with the Prieſts blowing three times in his Face, and anointing it with his Spittle, ſaying. <hi>Exi ab eo immunde Spiritus, &amp; tu autem effugare diabole, appropinquabit enim judicium Dei.</hi>
                  <q>Come out of him unclean Spirit; and thou Devil be gone, for the Judgment of God is at hand.</q> Together with this Prayer: <hi>Exorcizo te immunde ſpiritus in Nomine Patris,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>I exorcize thee unclean Spirit, in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, that thou mayſt come out of this ſervant of God, and depart from him, thou damned accurſed, for ſo he commands that walked upon the waters, and ſtretched out his hand to <hi>Peter</hi> when ſinking; therefore curſed Devil own and receive thy Sentence, and give honour to God, and come out of this his Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Other Exorcizings there are for the baptizing of adult perſons; ſo for the baptiſmal water it ſelf by blowing upon it three manner of ways, and pouring ſome of it towards the four parts of the world, and a long Prayer, whereby the Prieſt very imperiouſly commands, <hi>Omnis Spiritus immunde,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52252:21"/>omne phantaſma, omne mendacium, era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare &amp; effugare ab hac creatura aquae.</hi>
                  <q>All unclean Spirits, phantaſms, and lies to be rooted out of the water, and driven away from it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So are their Salts, and Oyls, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things of common uſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conjured, and the lurking Devils ferretted out of them. And what is all this but the diſgracing of Chriſtianity, and prophanation of Gods Sacred name?</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THeir Conſecrations are much to the ſame purpoſe, they mightily abuſe the holy duty of Prayer, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to every toy they have a fancy for, as much ſacredneſs and vertue as to any divine Ordinance or Chriſtian Sacrament. With their holy Water, they ſanctifie every thing, and are bleſt themſelves perpetually with it, living, and dying, and even after their death, when betwixt the hands of a deceaſed man they put a Croſs upon his breaſt, and every foot daſh him with holy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52252:21"/>Water, as is appointed in the Ritual. And no wonder, for it is conſecrated, <hi>to drive away devils, diſeaſes, and all evils; to have the vertue of divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and the effects of divine grace.</hi> And they pray that the holy Salt, which is its great ingredient, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to them that receive it, perfect <hi>health of ſoul and body, and freedom from the wiles and temptations of the devil.</hi> Every thing, and more than we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the holy Communion. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t efficiaris ſal exorcizatum in ſalutem credentium, &amp; ſis omnibus ſumentibus te ſanitas animae &amp; corporis,</hi> &amp;c. Their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread, <hi>pain benit,</hi> they bleſs, to be likewiſe to them that taſte of it <hi>the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſoul and body, and a ſafeguard againſt all dangers.</hi> And even the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Candles, <hi>where ever they are lighted, are to fright and expel away the Prince of darkneſs and all his Angels.</hi> The ſame is to be done by their holy Oyl and Incenſe. All their holy Garments and Church-Utenſils are bleſt much in the ſame manner, and to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>We find them praying, that the little Boxes for Relicks, or other conſecrated
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52252:22"/>things, <hi>may receive the dew of heavenly grace.</hi> Alſo that their Bells may do great feats, and that <hi>the dew of the Holy Spirit may be poured on them. Hoc tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinabulum ſancti ſpiritus rore perfunde.</hi> They alſo Exorcize the Chriſm for their many Unctions, and having purged it from the Devils that were bathing in it, pray <hi>that it may become to all that are anointed therewith, the adoption of Sons by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and that <hi>the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it may be to them a ſure and ſalutary defence and propitiation for ever. —<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t omnis virtus adverſarii, omnis exercitus diaboli, omniſque incurſio &amp; omne phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſma ſatanae eradicetur &amp; effugetur à te, ut fias omnibus qui ex te ungendi ſunt in adoptionem filiorum per ſpiritum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Much more as bad or worſe might be tranſcribed out of their Pontificals and Rituals, but it would be endleſs; and endleſs to ſhew all their Ceremonies for the Apparel and Ornaments of their Prieſt, Altars, Images; for their vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poſtures and Motions, for all their Ablutions and Purifyings, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated tools and toys they imploy in their miniſtrations, all which far exceed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52252:22"/>what was appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Worſhip of the Jewiſh Tabernacle. This is only that they who are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Books may ſee how contrary is the Roman Worſhip to the ſimplicity and ſpirituality of true Chriſtianity; how much Gods holy Name and Religion are abuſed by the abſurd Prayers and impious Exorciſms and Conſecrations of the Popiſh Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; and how thankful we ought to be that we can worſhip God in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of holineſs, without ſuch heaps of Superſtitions.</p>

                  <p>THeir way of celebrating the Lords Supper is become ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the ſacred inſtitution of it, and ſo diſhonourable to its bleſſed Author, that Chriſtians of other Communions tremble, and are ſeized on with horror when they conſider the Blaſphemies and Idolatries contained in the Doctrine and Worſhip of it. And accordingly they of <hi>Rome</hi> have preſt it theſe four
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52252:23"/>hundred years with the greateſt rigour, and made it the touch-ſtone and gin, whereby to know and to katch Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. To have a Chriſt made of Bread, as their Creed and Tridentine Canon abſolutely declare, againſt the evaſion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, who aſhamed of it, would make it to be a a <hi>Tranſubſtantiation adductive.</hi> Contrary to what their Church hath determined, <hi>that the whole ſubſtance of the bread is changed into the whole ſubſtance of Chriſts body:</hi> is a ſtrange account of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Union and of the Incarnation of our Bleſſed Saviour, and much to his diſhonour. As alſo to have their Chriſt appear, notwithſtanding all the Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Maſs, in circumſtances of the greateſt weakneſs and deſtitution. So that he muſt be carried, and lock'd, and cleanſed, being in danger of falling to the ground, of being loſt, of being mouldy and corrupted, of being eaten by Dogs or Vermin, and even abuſed at the Devils pleaſure to Sorcery and Witchcraft. What a contempt doth this reflect on the Lord of Glory, who once indeed abaſed himſelf for us very low: But now fitteth on the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52252:23"/>right hand of the Majeſty on high.</p>
                  <p>The Conſecrated Wafer, which they call <hi>the good God, their Creator, and their Saviour,</hi> they daily adore as ſuch, and that with a moſt profound and ſolemn Worſhip: both at the Altar, the Prieſt, and all the people; and abroad when it is carried about, to the great terrour and danger of all that are not of their perſuaſion. And this they conſtantly do, when even according to their own Principles, they never have any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that Chriſt by Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is preſent, under the ſpecies. For, want of Intention in the Prieſt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrates, or in them that ordained him, marrs the efficacy of the conſecrating words, fruſtrates the expectation of the Worſhipper, and makes them all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</p>
                  <p>It is further intolerable in this one part of their Worſhip, that they ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly take the Sacred Cup from the People, who are put away with a ſip of the ablution Wine, wherein the Prieſt waſheth thoſe fingers of his that touched the Hoſt.</p>
                  <p>And then, that their eating of Chriſt in the Maſs they make to be a <hi>true
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52252:24"/>propitiatory Sacrifice for the ſins of the living and the dead,</hi> as is at large aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſixth Seſſion of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> wherein ends the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of all their impious abſurd devices in this Point. They make Chriſt to ſacrifice him; and they ſacrifice him to gain Money by it. And how much this derogates from that all-ſufficient never to be repeated Sacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews at large in <hi>Epiſt. ad Hebr.</hi>) is ſadly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. But on theſe things I am not to enlarge. This is enough to ſhew the irreconcilableneſs of our conſcience (perſuaded as it is) with their way of daily Worſhip.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHerein is alſo very offenſive to us, that notwithſtanding God's expreſs command of not worſhipping any Images of any thing in heaven, or under heaven, they publickly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly render to the Croſs, and to the Images of the ever Bleſſed Trinity,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52252:24"/>that higheſt worſhip of <hi>Latreia,</hi> which they themſelves own to be due to God alone. And that to the Images of Saints, they give ſuch Religious reſpects and ſervices, as that nothing more of outward Worſhip can be paid to God himſelf. They carry them about in pomp with Hymns and high Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; they burn Candles to them, and to them make Offerings; they kiſs them, they burn Incenſe to them; they kneel and proſtrate themſelves before them, and before them make their Vows and Prayers; going to viſit them in long Pilgrimages: and from them, and what they repreſent, expecting all ſorts of bleſſings. All this is to be ſeen, not only in the practice of vulgar ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious People: But alſo in their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks and Liturgies, and their daily publick Worſhip, performed by their grave and devout Clergy. And that the evil of this may not be ſeen by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of people, they keep under a Buſhel, under ſevere reſtraints and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, the light of Gods Word, which in many places would ſhew them, how provoking and odious ſuch a Worſhip is to God, who declares
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52252:25"/>
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlii. 8. <hi>I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praiſe to graven Images.</hi> And in ſuch Books of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and devotion, as are uſed by the People, they take out of the Ten Commandments the ſecond, wherein God expreſly forbids their practice, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates to himſelf all Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and declareth himſelf highly Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of it.</p>
                  <p>Further, Whereas God who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exalted in a Throne of Glory and Dominion, above the higheſt creatures, is alſo infinitely good and beneficent, and ſo not only requires, but alſo infinitely deſerves all the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious love and ſervices our hearts are capable of, having given us our being, and all things that we either enjoy or hope; and even given us his own dear Son, when no Saint ſued for it in behalf of Mankind, and made him do all that was to be done for us, even die, and bear the ſorrows and ſhame of the Croſs, that we might ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52252:25"/>give us all things?</hi> When God hath done all this; and his bleſſed Son our dear Redeemer hath merited for us all that we can want, and commanded us to bring to him all our Requeſts and Petitions; Telling us, that it is by him alone we muſt have acceſs unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that he alone can ſave them to the uttermoſt that come to God by him, being ever living to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them. When thus God hath done all that could be done, that we might be obliged to none but to him, and have dependence on none elſe, is it not ſtrangely ungrateful and provoking, to ſee men ſeek for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Mediators, and Friends in the Court of Heaven to ſpeak and plead for them? As if either God were averſe to hear their Prayers, or the Interceſſion and Merits of our Bleſſed Saviour were not ſufficient to prevail, but in conjunction with thoſe of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>For ſo we find in moſt of their publick Prayers that they offer them in the name of all, or of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Saints, and expect for their ſakes to be heard, confiding much in their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52252:26"/>Merits and Mediation: And very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioning them to God, as motives why he ſhould grant their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. Numberleſs are the places where theſe, or the like expreſſions are uſed. <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo according to theſe great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits they receive (as they think) by means of the Saints, they make to them ſuitable returns: having invented many ways to requite their obligations, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52252:26"/>making them ſharers with God in all their religious reſpects; of which take theſe inſtances. In their daily Maſſes they make their Confeſſion to the Saints as to Almighty God, (ſee their <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor</hi>) they frequently mention the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Saints, eſpecially of thoſe whoſe Reliques are under the Altar; they profeſs in the <hi>Communion</hi> to vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the memory of all Saints, and for their ſakes, in the <hi>Poſt-Communion</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in ſeveral forms, that their oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt may be acceptable to God; or ſalutary to them, or the like. And whereas they declare that the honour of a ſacrifice is peculiar to God alone, and is by them reſerved for him: Yet we find that they cannot forbear to bring in the Saints for a ſhare. In the <hi>form of Intention,</hi> before the Maſs, The Prieſt profeſſeth <hi>to offer that, and all other Sacrifices, with all the good Works, Merits, Prayers, and Praiſes in Heaven and Earth, in memory of our bleſſed Saviours Paſſion, and to the honour and exultation of the bleſſed Virgin, and of all heavenly Angels and Saints. — Ad laudem quoque &amp; exultationem Beatiſſimae Virginis Mariae, coeleſtiumque

<q>O God, who doſt not diſlike that we ſhould paint or carve Images or ſemblances of thy Saints, we beſeech thee that this Image, made for the honour or memory of thy Son, or of ſuch an Apoſtle or Martyr, may by thee be bleſſed and ſanctified, and that thou wouldſt grant to all that ſhall ſupplicate and ſerve ſuch a Saint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, that they may by that Saints mediation obtain Grace here, and Glory herafter.</q> 
                     <hi>Amen.</hi> But to the Image of the bleſſed Virgin there are more Prayers, and amongſt them this is ſaid or ſung by the Biſhop and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52252:28"/>whilſt he ſprinkles it. <hi>Sub tuum praeſidium confugimus ſancta Dei Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, noſtras deprecationes ne deſpicias in neceſſitatibus, ſed à periculis cunctis libera nos ſemper, virgo glorioſa &amp; benedicta.</hi>
                     <q>We flee to thy protection, holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, deſpiſe not our Prayers in our neceſſities: But deliver us from all dangers at all times, O glorious and bleſſed Virgin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So at all occaſions, and in all parts of their publick Worſhip, God hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar to himſelf: And every where with our bleſſed Saviour ſome Saint or other is joyned.

<q>Holy Angel that art my Guardian, aſſiſt me, and pray for me, and ſuccour me, all ye holy Angels and Saints.</q> And then to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, <hi>Maria mater gratiae, mater miſericordiae, tu nos ab hoſte protege &amp; hora mortis ſuſcipe:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Mary</hi> Mother of grace and of mercy, protect us from our Enemies, and receive us when we die.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as in their Prayers, ſo in their Glorifications, the Saints muſt be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with Almighty God every where, as this one inſtance proves enough: <hi>Sacroſanctae &amp; individuae Trinitati,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Eternal praiſe, honour, vertue, and glory, be by all Creatures evermore rendred to the holy and individual Trinity: — To the Fruitfulneſs and integrity of the moſt bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Virgin, and univerſally to all Saints.</q> This Magnificat hath an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence annext to it by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. and is daily ſaid by all that recite the Breviary.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52252:29"/>
                  <p>By what hath been ſaid, and much more which is to be ſeen in their publick and moſt authorized Books, and daily practice, may appear what credit is to be given to thoſe Romiſh Emiſſaries, who very confidently deny their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints, or giving them any Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But that I may not be tedious, I forbear to give any more proofs to the contrary, and conclude with this, which is in their ordinary and allowed Manual of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh devotions. Thus,
<q>O holy and glorious Virgin <hi>Mary!</hi> I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my ſoul and body into thy bleſſed truſt and ſingular cuſtody, and this night and ever, eſpecially in the hour of my death, I commit to thy merciful charity all my hope and conſolation, all my diſtreſs and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, my life and the end thereof, that by thy moſt holy Interceſſion all my works may be directed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of thy bleſſed Son.</q> 
                     <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is now clear, that no Chriſtian that fears to offend God, by imparting to others that honour and worſhip due to him alone, can joyn with the Church
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52252:29"/>of <hi>Rome</hi> in their publick Worſhip. Nor poſſibly live in a Communion where ſuch a new Creed is impoſed, (as hath been ſeen before.) But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make uſe of Inquiſition, that where Conſcience keeps men from aſſenting and complying with ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Superſtitions, and Idolatries, there Terror may make them ſubmit. This is that Popiſh Religion, without which (as they ſay) no man ſhall live in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and without which, if they can, no man ſhall live upon earth.</p>
                  <p>Here it appears, that it was not a few tolerable abuſes, that made a great part of the Chriſtian world, ſo long wiſh and attempt, and at laſt with great trouble and danger, effect a happy Reformation, here in the Weſtern Churches, wherein the Popes Tyranny had ſet up and impoſed his Religion. Their indiſpenſable duty and allegiance to their God and Saviour obliged them to do it. The terms of Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and were moſt injurious to God, and repugnant to that Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip revealed and appointed in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52252:30"/>Goſpel, by our bleſſed Saviour. God muſt be obeyed, rather than Man: And no compleaſance, no conſideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obligeth any man to deſtroy or venture his own Salvation. This was their warrant, and upon this they might well expoſe themſelves to thoſe cruel perſecutions they endured, for being counted Rebels to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>But what is there, can oblige any man, enlightned with the knowledge of the truth, to ſeparate from this Church? Whereof the Faith is not a new and diſputable Creed: but that pure, Primitive and Catholick Doctrine which is contained in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and wherein God alone is duly worſhipped, the Sacraments of Chriſt rightly adminiſtred; wherein there are holy Prayers, conformable to Gods Word, humbly offered to him in the name of his bleſſed Son; wherein the Ceremonies are few, and grave, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, fit to expreſs and to encreaſe our Reverence and Devotion; and wherein the great deſign appears plainly to be, Gods glory, and mens ſalvation. What man that loves Goodneſs and Piety, and in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52252:30"/>ſeeks only to ſerve God, and ſave his own ſoul, can break Communion with this Church, if he be within its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts? Or will not rather judge it as much his duty, to joyn with it, as to ſeparate from <hi>Rome?</hi> A Government and Order, and a Liturgy of neceſſity there muſt be; all Chriſtian, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches have and maintain them, to prevent Confuſions, Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Innovations, ſuch as are here amongſt us eſtabliſhed oblige to nothing that God hath forbid; under them we may be vertuous and Religious in the higheſt degree, and ought therefore to be meek and peaceable; thankful to God that he hath graciouſly freed us from thoſe Romiſh impoſitions before mentioned. They that would break thoſe Rules that are now fix'd and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, either have little value for true Chriſtian Religion; or are willing to make way for Popiſh Innovations, or will make it appear that ſome tempers are ſo ungovernable, that nothing can hold them, but that Yoke and Tyranny of which I am now to ſpeak.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>How the Inquiſition came to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and firſt of the Oaths and Excommunications wherewith they tie the Conſciences of men.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is not for denying any Article of the Chriſtian Faith, that we, like our fore-fathers, are bloudily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, where-ever the Popes power can reach: Neither is it that we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a Falſe God, or are any ways im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious againſt the True one, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. It is for rejecting that Romiſh Creed and Worſhip, whereof I treated before. And it was not to maintain Chriſtianity, but thoſe corruptions, that Inquiſition was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and uſed with ſo much rigour. Any one that hath read the Life and Doctrine of our bleſſed Lord, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily judge that cruelties are deſtructive of her Religion, and cannot be fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to propagate or maintain it.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52252:31"/>But the maintaining of that formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Empire and Dominion the Pope and his Clergy have got into their hands, requires they ſhould proceed with that inexorable ſeverity they practiſe againſt them that diſſent from thoſe Doctrines, on which is grounded their power; therefore they oblige all that have any Juriſdiction among them by a ſtrict Oath of Allegiance, to be the Popes Subjects, and to endeavour all poſſible ways to make others be ſo. Thus: <hi>Ego</hi> N. <hi>electus Eccleſiae vel Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterii</hi> N. <hi>ab hac hora in antea, fidelis &amp; obediens ero, Beato,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>I <hi>N.</hi> elect of ſuch a Church or Monaſtery, from henceforth will be faithful and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to bleſſed <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, and to the Holy Roman Church, and to our Lord Pope <hi>N.</hi> and to his lawful Succeſſors. I will give no counſel or conſent that they ſhould loſe Life or Limb, or be any way injured upon any account. I will never, to their detriment, reveal to any what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel they ſhall truſt me with, by their Nuncios, or themſelves. I will help them againſt any man (ſaving my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to keep and maintain the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52252:32"/>Roman Papacy, and the Regalities of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> I will aſſiſt their Legates going and coming, and contribute to their neceſſities. I will endeavour to preſerve, defend, and encreaſe the authority, rights, honours, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Holy Roman Church, and of our Lord the Pope, and of his Succeſſors, And I will no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, but rather detect and hinder any thing that ſhould be to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. With all my ſtrength will I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and cauſe to be obſerved by others, all the Rules of the Fathers, and all Apoſtolick (<hi>i. e.</hi> Papal) De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Commands, Proviſions, and Reſervations. All Hereticks, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and Rebels to our ſaid Lord the Pope, and to his Succeſſors, will I oppoſe and perſecute. I will come, when called, to Synods, and once in three years come to <hi>Rome.</hi> And I will give an account to our Lord the Pope, of my Paſtoral Office, and of all things that pertain to the ſtate of my Church and Clergy. All Papal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions I will humbly receive, and moſt diligently execute, <hi>&amp;c. So help me God and theſe holy Evangils.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:52252:32"/>
               <p>Here is a good hold already, whereby all Secular and Regular Prelates are enſlaved to the Papacy, and to the Roman Doctrine and Worſhip. From which if they, or any other ſwerve, then are the direful thunderbolts of Excommunication lanc'd againſt them, with extinguiſhing of Candles, <hi>and, in the name of God and of his Saints, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them out of the Church in heaven and in earth: denouncing them to be curſed and anathematiz'd, and adjudging them to be damned in eternal fire, with the Devil and his Angels, and all Reprobates.</hi> As is to be ſeen in their form of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
               <p>All we reputed Hereticks, and all others that fall under this ſevere doom, are good for nothing afterwards, but to be deſtroyed any way poſſible, (as will be ſeen in what follows.) But if any, by terror, or hope, or any other inducement, are brought into their Church, from among Hereticks, he muſt climb over a high and difficult partition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, and be tied ſo ſhort, that he ſhall hardly ever think of a return. It is not, as they repreſent, to deceive the ſimple, only going amongſt them, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52252:33"/>be within the Pale of the Church, and do what you will: But after they have drawn you ſo far that you cannot go back, then you muſt in earneſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Church. And this is the manner of it, as is preſcribed in the <hi>Pontificale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The penitent Schiſmatick or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick muſt kneel before the Church-door, and there make a Confeſſion of his Faith, and have the Devil Exorciſed out of him. And being brought in, and kneeling before the High Altar, renounce all heretical pravity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to live in the unity of the Roman Faith, and have ſome Prayers and Groſſes made over him, and then ſwear obedience to the Pope, imprecating damnation to himſelf if ever he departs from the Communion of his Church; and if he were a noted Heretick, he is thus kneeling, to damn all Hereſies, that eſpecially which he leaves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all that ſtill hold it, worthy of an eternal Curſe, and upon his Oath profeſs to believe from his heart that Faith which is taught by the Roman Church: and promiſe if ever he quits it, to ſubmit himſelf to the ſeverity of the Canons.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52252:33"/>
               <p>This, one would think, ſhould be judged ſufficient by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to keep men in her obedience: But ſhe dares not truſt to it; as indeed experience hath ſhewn, that long agon the exorbitant greatneſs of the Papacy had been reduced, and a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation effected, if nothing but ties of Conſcience, or Excommunications had been uſed; other means therefore have been found, more violent, but more effectual. Inquiſition, managed with great rigour and great policy, hath been (as Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> called it, in a Bull I ſhall cite afterwards) <hi>Firmiſſimum Fidei Catholicae propugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum;</hi> The beſt and ſtrongeſt Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Catholick Faith. A truth which will manifeſtly appear when we have ſeen, how it was at firſt eſtabliſhed, and hath proceeded ever ſince.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe origin of the Inquiſition, if we may believe <hi>Lud A Paramo,</hi> is as ancient as the World. He himſelf, in <hi>Sicily</hi> for many years, was imployed about the <hi>Holy Office,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>A Paramo de orig.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matriti.</hi> 1598.</note> (as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call the Inquiſition) and was much in love with it. And he in good earneſt tells us, that God was the firſt <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> who when our firſt Parents were fell into Hereſie, came and made Inquiſition about it: But finding them diſpoſed to repent, mitigated their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and had them not rack'd and burn'd: but only deprived them of their eſtates, caſting them out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: Sent them, as it were, to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, adjudging them to hard labour and ſorrow; put upon them a kind of <hi>San benit,</hi> making them Coats of skins: All which merciful proceedings the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inquiſitors</hi> do now imitate towards Penitents. Afterwards (he tells us) the Patriarchs were appointed Judges in the caſe of Hereſie, and amongſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52252:34"/>them he puts <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he calls <hi>praeclarum Inquiſitorem,</hi> a famous Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor; though when the Jews ſought to kill our bleſſed Saviour, he told them, they could not be his Children, for <hi>that did not Abraham.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 8.</note> But however (as he goeth on) the Prophets afterwards ſucceeded in the office: and at laſt it came to our bleſſed Lord, who is now the Head of the <hi>Roman Inquiſition,</hi> but delegated it to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> from whom the Pope hath it.</p>
                  <p>This my Author tells us, in very good earneſt, and I make no doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it. But the true origin of the Inquiſition by delegation from the Pope, as it is now managed, was about the year 1216. when Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. appointed St. <hi>Dominic</hi> to be the firſt Inquiſitor, to repreſs the growing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> Before that, the Biſhops were the ſole Judges in the eaſe of Hereſie. And though before <hi>Dominic</hi> there had been, by the power or Inſtigation of ſeveral Popes, many Perſecutions raiſed againſt ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and many Princes and Biſhops, by intereſt or inclination, had been very ſevere
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52252:35"/>againſt them: yet that was not enough to uphold the Roman Errors and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; ſome Princes did favour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Hereticks, ſome Biſhops were tainted, and moſt of them too remiſs; they generally would not exerciſe ſuch cruelties over their own Sheep, as were requiſite to ſecure the Papal Intereſt: And the Popes, who were glad to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them as much as they could, and draw all their power to themſelves, found it neceſſary and expedient, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Commiſſioners by their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who ſhould depend wholly upon themſelves, to puniſh and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all that would not ſubmit to bear the Roman Yoak. Theſe they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and, as I ſaid, <hi>Dominic</hi> was the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Before him indeed, <hi>Charles the Great, anno</hi> 805. had appointed Judges to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch as turned Heathen, after they had profeſſed Chriſtianity: And they put many to death, in thoſe furtheſt parts of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces which that Emperour conquered: But that laſted not long, and differed much from the now-Inquiſition.</p>

                  <p>

But all this comes very ſhort of the Inquiſition, and neither came from the ſame Authority, nor proceeded by the ſame Methods; ſo that ſtill it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains true, as my Authors have it, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. was he that erected the <hi>Holy Tribunal,</hi> as they call their Helliſh Barbarities againſt poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>That Pope was he who firſt made Tranſubſtantiation an Article of Faith, in a Council he called at <hi>Lateran</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather under the name of it, as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> relates, who gives ſuch an account of this Pope, as alſo <hi>Platina,</hi> as makes him a worthy Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of ſuch a device as is the <hi>Holy Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> His Pride, Ambition, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs were in extreme, as thoſe Authors have it, and what his Kinſman and Succeſſor <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. records of him, in his <hi>Decretals,</hi> ſufficiently detects

<note place="margin">Tom. 3. p. 613.</note> St. <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſaith, that a very bright Star was ſeen upon his forehead when he was aſleep: And that he raiſed to life again nine perſons, three whilſt he lived, and ſix after his deſeaſe; ſo brave a thing it is to be a zealous propagator of the Roman Faith, which Faith he aſſerted (as <hi>A Paramo</hi> ſaith) by this notable Miracle: Having long diſputed in vain, he got two Books in his hands, one of them written by the Hereticks, containing their Errors; another writ by himſelf, containing the Doctrines of the Roman Faith: Then having aſſembled great numbers of people, and cauſed a great Fire to be made, he threw both the Books into it, and immediately that which contained the Heretical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines was conſumed, and the other nimbly leapt out of the fire, and being thrown in again the ſecond and third
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52252:37"/>times, did not like the warmth of it, but ſtill came out ſafe and ſound out of the devouring Flames.</p>
                  <p>But this would not do, and it was found requiſite to throw the Hereticks themſelves into the fire, for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conviction: Wherefore <hi>Dominic</hi> having obtained from the Pope a power and delegation to be <hi>Inquiſitor, an.</hi> 1216. fell to work in good earneſt, to butcher ſuch ſtray Sheep as the proper Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds could not, or would not reduce. Nature ſeemed to be affraid of thoſe horrid cruelties which were now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be exercized at the Tremendous Tribunal of the Inquiſition, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about this time many Prodigies ſeen, to the great affrightment of many Nations; Monſters, Inundations, and Earthquakes, in <hi>Italy, Savoy, Germany,</hi> and elſewhere, as is to be ſeen in the Authors that treat of this Century: But <hi>Dominic,</hi> and the other Bigots of the Roman Church, took it another way, and would have theſe to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the wrath of God againſt Hereticks; and ſo came with great zeal and fury to be executioners of that wrath, and to deſtroy them.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52252:38"/>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> had ſeen a Viſion, as <hi>Bzovius</hi> reports, to this purpoſe: Chriſt appeared in great anger, ready to caſt down upon wicked men the extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Thunder-bolts of his Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that the bleſſed Virgin inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and aſſured him ſhe had two men, two valiant Champions, who would reduce all things to right if he would but be patient, and then ſhewed him St. <hi>Dominic</hi> and St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and he became pacified.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two, whatever the Tale be, offered to God many humane Victims, as though they had indeed deſigned thereby to appeaſe his wrath; the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans</hi> became Inquiſitors in <hi>Italy,</hi> in honour of their Founder, there born: And the <hi>Dominicans</hi> had the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in <hi>Spain,</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>But to return. <hi>Dominic</hi> work'd very many Miracles, and had very free entercourſe with heaven, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Bzovius,</hi> who is very prolix upon that ſubject, (<hi>ad anno</hi> 1211. <hi>&amp; deinceps.</hi>) But that which makes for my purpoſe is his coming with <hi>Didacus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſma,</hi> and with twelve Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots to preach the Croiſadoes; that is,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52252:38"/>to levy Souldiers, that would engage againſt the Hereticks, and to make an Army of zealous men, who ſhould have a Croſs for their Badge, and ſhould be in perpetual War againſt the Enemies of Chriſt, as they called the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and other Diſſenters from <hi>Rome.</hi> He himſelf would carry a Croſs in his hand, when ſhe went to fight, and all the Arrows that were thrown at him, did only peirce the Croſs, but never touch him: Whereby his Fellow-Souldiers were wonderfully encouraged, (as they report it.)</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Dominic</hi> inſtituted, he choſe out the moſt fierce, bloudy, implacable Zealots of his numberleſs Croſs-bearers, and made of them a ſelect Company or Fraternity, which he called Chriſt's Familiar Souldiers. <hi>Familiares Chriſti milites. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t accerime haereticos inſectaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; impetu quam poſſent maximo, in illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum perniciem irruerent.</hi> So <hi>A Paramo</hi> words it,

                  <hi>DOminic</hi> having erected his Court, and got power enough, what from the Pope, what from his <hi>Familiars,</hi> to make it ſo ſtrong as to do that work it was deſigned for, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt Hereticks with as much ſeverity, as the bloudy Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> can inſpire. He added to all the former rigours and cruelties; and though he made uſe of ſeveral forms and ways of judging and puniſhing Hereticks found out before him, yet he tied himſelf to none, but with ſuch a certain method, which hath not been much changed ſince; he followed no other rules, but his own pleaſure in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting puniſhments upon guilty or ſuſpected perſons. And ſo it remains to this day, moſt dreadful and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52252:40"/>
               <p>Thoſe Hereticks, againſt whom the Pope and his Friends were ſo angry, have a very ill name given by ſuch as put them to death, and, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Enemies, were very vile and wicked: But when we find full as bad ſaid of us, in many late Writers, we have great reaſon to ſuſpect that then, as now, they painted Hereticks like Devils (as they do when they burn them) to juſtifie their hatred and their cruelty againſt them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Beguini</hi> and <hi>Beguardi, the poor men of Lions,</hi> or <hi>Minorits de tertia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula Sancti Franciſci.</hi> The <hi>Stadingenſes,</hi> and others in the twelfth and thirteenth Century, were moſt likely of the ſame Religion, as to the ſubſtance, as the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> men that ſighed and endeavoured for a Reformation, and could not hold Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of its great corruptions, but that held the ſame Primitive Faith as we do. There is enough in <hi>Reinerius,</hi> even as it is ſet out by <hi>Grotſerus</hi> the Jeſuit, to juſtifie this. He had been one of them, of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and changed, and became Inquiſitor againſt them: but together
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52252:41"/>with the expreſſions of his malice, gives ſuch an account of them, as makes it moſt clear that they are highly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as well in their Names as in their Perſons.</p>
               <p>What cruelties were exerciſed againſt them, by the urgent inſtigation of this Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> who by Bulls, ſwarms of Preachers of Croiſadoes, and the bloudy and traiterous Decrees of his <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, excited and forced many Princes to butcher in moſt parts of <hi>Europe</hi> thoſe ſheep appointed to be ſlain; what faint reſiſtance they made for a while, aſſiſted by ſeveral great Princes, the Counts of <hi>Tholoſa, Foix, Beam,</hi> and others, with <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Aragon;</hi> how many lying Miracles, but truly bloudy Executions were acted by <hi>Simon Monfort,</hi> and other Generals of the Popes <hi>Gros't-Souldiers?</hi> All theſe are to be ſeen in <hi>Petrus Valiſſarnenſis</hi> the Monk, who then lived, and writ the Hiſtory of thoſe <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> whom he terribly hated. <hi>Spondanus</hi> alſo hath enough of thoſe matters <hi>ad an.</hi> 1200. <hi>&amp; deinceps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know that he makes <hi>Petrus de Caſtro novo,</hi> a <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Monk, and <hi>Arnoldus</hi>

Therein I ſaw that the forms of the ſeveral ſorts of Sentences againſt Delinquents, were much the ſame as they are now. And that the account it gives of the Crimes or Hereſies of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> agrees very well with what is found in <hi>Reine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and others, for the juſtification of thoſe perſecuted good Chriſtians, of whom I ſhall give a ſhort account.</p>

<q>
                        <hi>John Aimonius</hi> of <hi>Alzona,</hi> &amp;c. it appears
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52252:42"/>by his Confeſſion, taken in due form of Law, that ſome thirty years before his ſaid Confeſſion, his Mother <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotta</hi> had as it were bewitched him with certain ſtrangers who uſed to come to his Fathers houſe in <hi>Alzona,</hi> that he might not reveal them to any, they being of that ſort of men, who were called <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and who in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> were apprehended by the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, and burned, as many as could be found. She commended them to him as good men, and he promiſed he would not diſcloſe them. Alſo, that much about that time, <hi>Geraldus,</hi> Provincial of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reſort to his Fathers houſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alone, ſometimes with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and once with <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Valdenſis,</hi> and there lie and eat and drink of what the houſe afforded; and that he heard his words and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and amongſt other things, that a mortal ſin to ſwear, or kill a man, in or out of judgment.

And nothing can more clear the Innocence of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted people, than the accuſations and convictions, which were then brought againſt them in the Courts of the Inquiſitors, their profeſt and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable enemies, wherein we ſee nothing of thoſe either ſilly or impious Errors, which many of the Romiſh Writers are pleaſed to impute to them.</p>

               <p>NOw I ſhall give you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſetting up, or reſtoring the <hi>Sacred Tribunal</hi> in ſeveral places. The Inquiſition was ſo ſucceſsful in <hi>Tholoſa,</hi> and it ſo well agreed with the principles of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion, and the genius of the Roman Popes, that Frier <hi>Lambertus</hi> was authorized to be St. <hi>Dominic</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor, to help him to promote that work which ſo well proſpered in his hands. And that holy Father <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> III. and his Succeſſors uſed all their ſtrength and endeavours, and watched all opportunities to erect in all places ſuch a Court as <hi>holy Dominic</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. In many Cities of <hi>France,</hi> and even in <hi>Paris</hi> it was erected, as appears by a Bull of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> 47. 1258. In <hi>Hetruria,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friers were made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52252:47"/>and appointed to proceed, <hi>anno</hi> 1258.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. ſome twenty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had in <hi>Navarra</hi> and the adjacent parts, committed the judging and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of Hereſie, by way of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to the <hi>Dominicans.</hi> In <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi> alſo, which was the refuge of the <hi>Waldenſes, Dominic</hi> had at the very firſt taken care, that they ſhould be duly proſecuted and deſtroyed. In the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Provinces Frier <hi>Robert</hi> and other Inquiſitors did burn very many of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> In many parts of <hi>Germany</hi> alſo, the like was done by times. In <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> it is more uncertain when the Inquiſition began, and ſome are of opinion there was none in thoſe parts before King <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> But <hi>A Paramo</hi> tells us, that in ſome Cities in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> there are extant Bulls of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment IV. 1267. whereby the Provincial of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> is impowered to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point out of his Order Inquiſitors againſt Heretical pravity, in all the parts of that Kingdom which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians poſſeſſed: And that <hi>Boniface</hi> IX. granted by a Bull the ſame power to <hi>Vincentius Lisboa,</hi> and to <hi>Toſtatus Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſis,</hi>

                  <p>BUt if <hi>Spain</hi> was free for ſome time of the Inquiſition, it had ſince that its turn to ſome purpoſe. When <hi>Clement</hi> V. commanded the Inquiſitors every where, to enquire into the Crimes and Hereſies of the Knight Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars, and to deſtroy them, about the year 1314. No mention, ſaith <hi>A Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> is made of their proceedings in the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> And likely it is that the Biſhops jealous of their power, had there and elſewhere much abated the credit and authority of the <hi>holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,</hi> which for ſome Ages had not much to do, Hereticks being grown leſs numerous, or leſs known, by reaſon of the ſeverity of the Inquiſition at firſt. But about the year 1480. and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Inquiſition regained its firſt vigour and power, not only in <hi>Spain,</hi> but every where elſe. The occaſion of it is ſaid to be this.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52252:48"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alphonſus Hojeda,</hi> Prior of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> houſe in <hi>Sevil,</hi> being migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty zealous againſt thoſe Jews who ſought to corrupt the Chriſtian Faith, was informed by a noble and credible Citizen, of the Family of the <hi>Guſmans,</hi> that on <hi>Thurſday</hi> before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> ſome Jews and Apoſtates had met in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain houſe and uttered Blaſphemies, and performed impious Rites, of all which the Prior immediately certified their Catholick Majeſties, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who much grieved at it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him and others to make what inquiries they could into that horrid fact, by which means ſix of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals were found out, apprehended, and caſt into Priſons. This being famed throughout that great City, awakened the Zeal of Chriſtians, and induced many to inform againſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and ſuch Jews as were active in perſuading Chriſtians to obſerve the Old Teſtament. <hi>Petrus Gonzalez a Mendoza,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sevil,</hi> and and <hi>Thomas a Turre-Cremata,</hi> a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, Confeſſor to their Majeſties, and Favourite, were both moſt notorious for their zeal and fierceneſs. This laſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52252:49"/>took great pains to perſuade their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, that to ſecure Religion, the Laws and and Decrees of the Popes ſhould be put in execution againſt all Hereticks whatever, without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or mercy, and obtained leave and power for himſelf and the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to proceed, and ſee what they could do in that weighty matter. They ſhed much bloud, and tried many ways, and at laſt did reſolve that the reſtoring and better ordering of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition was that alone that could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Catholick Faith. Upon this therefore they did ſpend all their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and their Induſtry, and with much ado perſuaded the King and Queen to aſſent to it, and to obtain of Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Quartus</hi> the ſetting up again of the Inquiſition. To this <hi>his Holineſs</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſented, and by a gracious Bull impowered their Majeſties to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors in the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon.</hi> But leſt Inquiſitors made by Royal Authority ſhould not do their buſineſs thoroughly, he appointed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Cenſors of Faith in <hi>Sevill,</hi> elſewhere he himſelf appointed Dominicans to look to the <hi>Sacred Office,</hi> and in a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52252:49"/>manner revoked that power he had granted the King; and in the year 1484. <hi>Innocent</hi> VIII. conſtituted <hi>Turre Cremata</hi> Inquiſitor General, who ſhould depute others, under him, as he ſhould think fit, and as appears by his Bull, ſubjected the Inquiſitions of <hi>Arragon, Valentia, Cathalonia,</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> to the ſupreme Inquiſitor of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> who is now authorized both by Pope and King.</p>

                  <p>THis Spaniſh Inquiſition hath a power ſo irreſiſtible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, and is ſo fierce and rigorous in its proceedings, that it is altogether framed according to the Popes liking, and is become the Model of a true Papal Inquiſition, ſuch as his <hi>Holineſs</hi> would eſtabliſh every where, if he could. It goeth quite through the Spaniſh Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and was once eſtabliſhed even in their Fleets at Sea under the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> II. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. made <hi>Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52252:50"/>a Mendoca</hi> Naval Inquiſitor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe about the year 1571, there were found men of ſeveral Religions, in thoſe Gallies that aſſiſted the Italian Princes againſt the Turks.</p>
                  <p>This Inquiſition thus ſhipped and got to Sea, was ſoon tranſported into the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, and into both the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> in all the Dominions of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> But into <hi>Portugal</hi> it ſelf it was reſetled by a crafty Knave, as is related by ſome, and believed by my Author,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A Paramo.</hi> p. 228.</note> who gives a large account of the pranks he plaid, to effect by his wits, what the earneſt deſires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ſeveral Popes had not been able to do. His name was <hi>Sahabedra,</hi> an inconſiderable and daring Villain, who about the year 1536. came into that Kingdom as being a Cardinal, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, and Inquiſitor of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III. He had ſome Money, and borrowed more by the help of ſome Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and having gotten a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and brave Ornaments, and forged Bulls and Seals, he began to uſe his power in <hi>Spain,</hi> and to play the Inquiſitor. This he did ſo neatly, that every body took him to be one indeed:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52252:50"/>And when he came into <hi>Portugal,</hi> well furniſhed with Moneys he had gotten from Spaniſh Hereticks, he ſtruck a terror into the Country, as he paſſed along, and by his Officers had many Jews and Hereticks ſeized and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, whom he ſeveral ways puniſhed as became an Inquiſitor. King <hi>John</hi> amazed and aſtoniſhed at the zeal and courage of this ſtout undertaker, gave way to his proceedings, who would have done, no doubt, moſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable feats, had he not unluckily been diſcovered by ſome that came from <hi>Rome,</hi> and apprehended, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to no ſeverer doom than to the Gallies, though by his pretended au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he had maimed and deſtroyed many perſons. No death would have been too bad for ſuch a Villain, in any other caſe: But this went for a witty cheat, as long as it was againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and proved the happy occaſion of reſtoring the Inquiſition. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III. interceded in his behalf, and his bowels yearned over him, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Paul</hi> IV. did redeem him from the Gallies.</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:52252:51"/>
                  <p>As bold an attempt, but not ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, the ſame Author relates of Eight Dominican Friers, who went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dominions of <hi>Presbyter John,</hi> and erected by degrees an Inquiſition among the Chriſtian <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> but were themſelves torn to pieces, and ſo could only ſhew their good, will. Such is the deſperate zeal of Roman Bigots.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BY thus ſetling the Inquiſition in ſo many places, we may ſee, what a formidable and lawleſs power the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> had here in the Weſt, for ſome hundreds of years, before the Reformation. No Yoke could be heavier or more unacceptable to Princes and People than that bloudy Tribunal, and yet they were forced to be willing to be ſlaves to it. In <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſome Kings have ſtrugled
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52252:51"/>againſt it, but to little purpoſe. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſpight of all endeavours to the contrary, will ever have a mighty influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on all humane affairs, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Rome</hi> being ſo contrived, as to make its Profeſſors ſubmiſſive Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to that Court, the Impoſitions of it muſt be ſubmitted to, though tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, unreaſonable, and againſt the liking of ſuch as muſt bear them. <hi>A Paramo</hi> himſelf relates many Complaints, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and bloudy ſcuffles againſt the Inquiſition, of ſuch as either had ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſighed under its intolerable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or of ſuch as trembled at the thoughts of its being ſetled among them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Arragon, anno</hi> 1484. there were loud and pitious clamours of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt the Confiſcations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of that dreadful Tribunal. In <hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> about the ſame time, there were inſurrections and mighty endeavours to have ſhaken off that heavy yoke. In the <hi>Baleares Inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae,</hi> in <hi>Majorca</hi> and elſe where, the <hi>Holy Tribunal</hi> became moſt hated, it was perſecuted bitterly, many Inquiſitors were driven away, and the People
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52252:52"/>made ſuch tumultuous and violent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours againſt it, as were hardly allayed. In <hi>Sardinia,</hi> about the year 1498. there were alſo many quarrels and diſturbances by reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and the King's Lieutenant, with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Callary</hi> did by main force break into the Priſons of the Inquiſition, to deliver a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Herefie. In <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the Inquiſition is moſt formidable, there have been frequently long feuds and conteſts betwixt the Inquiſitors, and Secular Judges. Even at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> IV. was dead, <hi>anno</hi> 1559. the People gathered together, and with great fury broke into the ſtrong houſe of the Inquiſitors, tore down all the doors, committed many outrages, loaded with blows and indignities <hi>Thomas Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotus</hi> General of the Inquiſition, and his Adjutant <hi>Seraphinus Cavalli,</hi> and almoſt burnt the ſtately Monaſtery of St. <hi>Mary ſuper Minervam,</hi> becauſe it had expreſſed much reſpect and good will for the Inquiſition. But the worſt thing of this nature did happen at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> whereby it was almoſt deſtroyed. King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52252:52"/>to ſet up again an Inquiſition in that populous City, but the People ſo ſtrongly oppoſed it, that it took no effect, till that potent Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. at the earneſt ſolicitation of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III. effected it with great difficulty. The Pope gave good words and large promiſes to the Citizens, and aſſured them by a Bull, that their own men ſhould be the Judges of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition: but for all that they knew and did dread what the event would be, if once that black Tribunal were ſet up, therefore they bound themſelves by Oaths that they would never ſuffer it, but would rather chuſe to loſe their lives, as they did alſo, many of them, at ſeveral occaſions: Eſpecially when two men being carried to Priſon, by the Officers of the Inquiſition, cried as they went along, that they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the power of the Inquiſitors. and were led to die in their Dungeons; whereat the people incenſed, riſe in great tumults, and filled the Town with bloud and confuſion, and had their houſes battered about their ears, by the great Guns from the Caſtle, which plaid upon them. But after all they were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52252:53"/>fain to admit what was ſo fearful and odious to them.</p>
               <p>Almoſt the like had hapned long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the City of <hi>Parma,</hi> in the time of <hi>Martin</hi> IV. there was a long and bloudy Tumult, occaſioned by the burning of a woman for Hereſie, and <hi>Florius</hi> the Inquiſitor was killed by the People; as many more have been, of thoſe Miniſters of cruelties, whom therefore the Pope hath Sainted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Martyrs.</p>
               <p>But all this reſiſtance the People made in ſo many places againſt Papal Inquiſition, could avail nothing. The Pope held them partly by the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and partly by external force; having, as he hath, numerous Armies, in all Popiſh Countries, of Friers and Monks, who can handle both Swords, the Spiritual and Temporal, and can engage many Zealots to ſide with him, who is believed to be Chriſt's Vicar, and the infallible Head of the Church, to whom every ſoul muſt be ſubject, under pain of damnation: having ſo great and united a ſtrength, he muſt needs carry it, at long run, againſt the ſcattered Forces, of unheaded Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52252:53"/>
                  <hi>France</hi> indeed hath caſt off long ago the yoke of the Inquiſition, and preſerved ſome more liberty: but it hath been upon condition, that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in it ſhould be maſſacred, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and deſtroyed by ſome other means. And even the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> as jealous as it is of its liberty, and apprehenſive of the Popes ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and tyrannical deſigns: even <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> with all its policy, hath been fain to admit of an Inquiſition. In the year 1378. <hi>Ludovicus Donatus,</hi> a Franciſcan, was there appointed by the Pope, though with leſſer power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſſer ſeverity than elſewhere. For there the Patriarch and ſome Senators, who are Venetians, always ſit with the Inquiſitor. And when <hi>Pius Quintus, anno</hi> 1564. would have brought in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition, it was ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed, that he was fain to give over.</p>
               <p>But now by the riſe of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> whoſe Order <hi>Paul</hi> III. confirmed, there is come ſo great an acceſſion of Forces to the Pope, that if but this Proteſtant Kingdom can be ruined, and brought under him again, it will be eaſie for him
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52252:54"/>to regain all the power he hath loſt, and to make the Inquiſition of as large an extent as his Religion. Which if God ſhould ever permit, and by that means puniſh our unquiet, ungoverna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirits, and our contempt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Order, it is not to be doubted but the Pope with his Friers and Jeſuits would take care ſo to ſettle the <hi>Holy Tribunal,</hi> as to cut off together with our Religion, all hope of ever being free from that Romiſh Tyranny.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the ordering of the Inquiſition.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAd the Inquiſition at firſt been modelled and looked after, as it hath been ſince the times of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and ſince the Reformation, it would not have decayed and been neglected, as it was in moſt places for about two hundred years. <hi>Dominicus</hi> and his Succeſſors for about an hundred years proceeded vigourouſly, and in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52252:54"/>that time deſtroyed ſo many Millions of ſuch as diſſented from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſtruck ſuch a terrour in the reſt, that they were fain to lie cloſe and concealed; and where they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the Biſhops alone could eaſily deſtroy them: or other means were uſed to keep them under.</p>
               <p>They had no ſure Methods at firſt to proceed by, and there occurred now and then ſuch difficulties that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors were fain to repair to <hi>His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> to know his pleaſure, which was the great Rule they went by, and mean while the concerns of the <hi>Holy Tribunal</hi> were much hindred or negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by reaſon of their abſence. Indeed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> IV. 1260. endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this inconvenience, by creating a General of the Inquiſition, to whom Inquiſitors from all parts might freely ſend for aſſiſtance or direction, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Bulls which conſtituted Cardinal <hi>Caetan,</hi> who afterwards was <hi>Nicolas</hi> III. the firſt General, wherein the Pope tells the Inquiſitors: <hi>Pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſa &amp; gravia Impedimenta quae praedicto negotio vobis emerſerint, dilecto Fr. Joh. S. Nicolai in Arce Juliano Diacono
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52252:55"/>Cardinali quem eidem praefecimus negotio, ſignificare curetis,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>That in all caſes wherein they ſhould be unable to proceed, or doubtful what to do, they ſhould acquaint the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who inſtructed by him, would find to every evil a proper remedy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So far it was well, and this might have done much; but afterwards <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> V. let it fall, and made no Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Office became very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, many after-Popes neglecting it, as <hi>Celeſtine</hi> had done, till at laſt <hi>Paul</hi> III. who died in love with the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and in commending of it, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Generalſhip to certain Cardinals, and ſo fixed and appointed it, that it hath never been diſcontinued ſince. And now in ſpight of all former cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and oppoſitions, the Reformation of Religion having appeared and made great progreſs, Inquiſition was to ſtand in great ſtead. Hereſies did ſpread far and near, and even in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> were like to prevail, wherefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved the Pope to ply hard his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Engine; when all lay at ſtake, and no other means could prevent what he ſo much dreaded, the reſtoring of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52252:55"/>things to their Primitive ſtate: The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore did then ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make the <hi>Holy Tribunal</hi> as uſeful and ſerviceable as might be.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe the Canoniſts were ſet upon, to ſtate the Caſe of Hereſie, and ſhew what ways the Inquiſitors might beſt find it out, and moſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and compendiouſly puniſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate it. And in this they became very prolix, and a world of them about that time in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> writ Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes upon this ſubject. Then alſo came out many Bulls for the ordering and encouraging of the Inquiſition, to enlarge its power and privileges. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riola</hi> and <hi>Pegna,</hi> famous for their skill in thoſe affairs, reckon above 110, for about the ſpace of thirty or forty years, from the time of <hi>Hadrian</hi> VI. who was Pope <hi>anno</hi> 1522. till their own time, all which Bulls were for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Inquiſition, and the ruin of Hereticks.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the proceedings of the Inquiſition.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe proceedings of this dreadful Court being terrible and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, much maligned by the People, and againſt the very propenſities of humane nature, are therefore ſecret and ſilent, there is nothing that makes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52252:60"/>a noiſe, or that appears abroad, except it may be once a year, when they make a brave ſhew and Pageant of <hi>the act of Faith,</hi> which is the day of publick execution; all the reſt is remote from witneſs and obſervation, ſaving what is previous to the impriſonment.</p>
               <p>There is, with ſome difference in every Kingdom or State where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition is ſet up, a General of it, who in his Precinct is ſupreme, but is accountable to the great General of all, who reſides at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation wherein the Pope preſides, (as is before ſaid.) This Inferiour General with other Inquiſitors, deputed and authorized by the Pope, manageth all the affairs within his Diſtrict, that belong to the Cognizance of the <hi>Holy Tribunal,</hi> which is erected but in few places, though it commands all the Country.</p>
               <p>Here and there in the great Cities ſome of the Inquiſitors reſide, in the Monaſtery of their Order, which is commonly a ſtrong and ſtately Houſe for the purpoſe, half a Caſtle, and half a Goal, fitted with all conveniences requiſite, Dungeons, inſtruments of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52252:60"/>torture, Officers of all ſorts, and two or three of the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, Franciſcans, or Jeſuits of late, who are the Judges of the Court, and many other Friers of the ſame Order.</p>
               <p>Herein men are brought ſeveral ways; by a Citation, which they call <hi>Verbalis,</hi> when the party hath a good Eſtate, (which ſometimes is his guilt) and being really no Heretick, is not likely to run away. Then they ſend to him one of their Officers, to tell him that <hi>the moſt Reverend the Inquiſitors, will ſpeak with him, about ſome things that concern his ſoul;</hi> and this is the verbal Citation. But if he be really tainted, or ſtrongly ſuſpect of Hereſie, and like to abſcond, then they begin by a Citation which they call real; that is, by ſeizing upon him. The <hi>Captura,</hi> or apprehenſion, is that which they call <hi>Realis Citatio;</hi> as <hi>Caeſar Carena,</hi> a late Author, and many others before him, tell us.</p>
               <p>When they appear who are brought in either way, the Inquiſitors, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look and ſpeak grave and ſerious, tell them with a demure countenance,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52252:61"/>and in ſoft and godly language, that they are obliged by the duty of their holy Office to ſearch into the Truth of ſome things which much concern the honour of God, and his eternal happineſs; and then after ſeveral queſtions, and grave exhortations that they would examine themſelves, and find out and confeſs wherein they are guilty, they commit them to cuſtody; or it may be, he that had the Verbal Citation is ſent home, and ordered to return within ſo many days, and ſoberly admoniſhed to look to himſelf, and to do what becomes a good Catholick.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I. <hi>Of the Accuſations:</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is to be ſuppoſed, before a man be thus cited, that he hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and ſometimes it is true, though by ſome other means he may be brought into that evil net, out of which no man can ever wholly free himſelf: But accuſations are the moſt frequent beginnings of the Tragedy, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or falſe, there is no fence
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52252:61"/>againſt them. It is not here as in the Secular Tribunals of Princes, where you make your legal defence, and know what witneſſes and accuſations are againſt you, and are confronted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Accuſers, and every thing is tranſacted publickly: But in the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition your Judge generally is your enemy, who deſigns you an ill turn; your defence ſignifies nothing, you can have no friend in that horrid Den, to hear or ſee what is ſaid or done; and you never know who accuſeth you, or of what. It is a rule in the practice of that Court, <hi>Nunquam ſunt publicandi teſtes.</hi>
                     <q>That the Witneſſes muſt never be publiſhed or declared.</q> And <hi>A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramo</hi> tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 159. that when <hi>Charles</hi> V. yet young, was mightily preſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his authority, that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the Court of Inquiſition might be known and confronted, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and 800000. Piſtols were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him by the Spaniards to do it, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Franciſcus Ximenius,</hi> the then General of the Inquiſition, withſtood and hindred it, becauſe it would bring danger and diſcouragement to the Witneſſes, and in a great meaſure
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52252:62"/>hinder the proceedings of the <hi>Holy Tribunal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The accuſations then, are all clancular, no man knows whence the deadly blow comes; and there is this further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in it, that the Witneſs is not to prove the truth of what he chargeth upon another, but the Judge is to make it out, by tortures, or by what means he can; <hi>Non ſubit onus probandi qui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciat, ſed judici onus remittit;</hi> ſo their Directories tell us,
<q>The Judge, and not the Accuſer is to make proof of the accuſation.</q> And whether proof be made or not, ſtill the Inquiſitors may proceed, for according to one of their Rules, any <hi>indicium,</hi> likelihood, or ſuſpicion warrants all their proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Non eſt neceſſe ad procedendum probari corpus delicti.</hi> And ſo we need not marvel if there have been ſo many attempts to ſhake of this Tyranny, for no man is ſafe under it, no not the moſt zealous Romaniſt.</p>
                  <p>The Accuſer is at no trouble, nor no charge at all; if he comes by way of <hi>Denunciation,</hi> as they call it, that is, by naming them that know the Fact. That ſuch and ſuch know that <hi>N. N.</hi> ſaid or
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52252:62"/>did ſuch heretical things. The Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors takes ſome of his Servants to be Witneſſes of this, and then the Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciator hath no more to do.</p>
                  <p>Or if the Accuſer ſpeaks as of his own knowledge, after his Information taken he is free, and were it never ſo improbable or falſe, it lies in the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors breaſt to proceed as he ſhall pleaſe afterwards. And whether the proofs be weak or ſtrong, or none at all, as ſoon as a man any ways is defferred as guilty, the <hi>Fiſcalis,</hi> who is a Civil Officer, and as it were the Kings Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor in the holy Office, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Confederate with the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, inſlaved to their pleaſure by Oaths and Intereſt, comes and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the quarrel, <hi>&amp; petit capturam Rei,</hi> as the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> ſay, demands that the real or pretended Criminal may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and begins the proſecution in this manner:</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt before I give an account of the farther poceedings of the <hi>Holy Tribunal</hi> againſt ſuch as are brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, I muſt ſay ſomething of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulations; for now and then when the Judges think fit, it takes a walk into the Country, and viſits thoſe parts that are remote from the place of its conſtant abode. This Viſitation of the Inquiſitors was wont to carry great terror where-ever it went, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and about the time of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, there were many every where, who liked and promoted the deſign of Reforming, and had ſecretly imparted their thoughts to ſuch who were of the ſame mind. For if but two or three were taken, and in the midſt of Tortures, or for fear of them, did ſpeak all they knew, they cauſed many others to be apprehended, and whole Monaſteries and Villages were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken and deſtroyed, and a great dread and conſternation fell upon the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52252:66"/>whole Party: So that when the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> cauſed <hi>Edicts of Grace</hi> to be promulged, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing impunity to all Hereticks and Apoſtates that ſhould return to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith within thirty days, <hi>A Paramo</hi> tells us, that it hath ſometimes brought in ſeventeen thouſand men and women, who rather than venture to fall into the hands of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, would ſay and do any thing, though never ſo contrary to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>Edicts of Grace</hi> were to be publiſhed the firſt time that the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors viſited any Province, whether they are ſtill uſed, I am not able to tell: But ſure I am, he Pope never ſpake any thing more infallibly true than when he ſaid that the Inquiſition had brought in a <hi>plentiful Harveſt,</hi> as we have ſeen in the Bull of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> for indeed there were <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>beres fructus,</hi> if Bloud, Confiſcations, and hypocritical Converts may be called a fruitful Income.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Inquiſitors, one or more, are arrived in any place, they ſend for the greateſt Bigots, the moſt furious
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52252:66"/>haters of Hereticks, and ask them who they are that are counted ſuſpect in the Country. They ſend for whom they will, and queſtion and ſwear them upon what Articles they pleaſe; and they make them that are moſt cunning and zealous their ſpecial Bayliſſs or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars,</hi> and oblige them by oath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and inform againſt all Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Then they publiſh their <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,</hi> and with dreadful formalities excommunicate and curſe all that ſhall not reveal whatever they know that hath been ſaid or done againſt the Pope, and Church, and the Catholick Faith; and ſome have been ſo terrified by theſe, that to diſcharge their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſcience they have accuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for wandring thoughts or dreams that were heretical, and have done for it a ſevere pennance, in the Inquiſitors Jailes.</p>
                  <p>In theſe rural Viſitations the whole proceſs againſt Hereticks is ſeldom made an end of, the judges commonly go no further in it than to what may ſerve to detect the accomplices, and the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are carried to that principal City where the Inquiſition is ſeated, there to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52252:67"/>be proceeded againſt according to the grave and formal Methods of the <hi>Holy Tribunal,</hi> of which I ſhall proceed to give an account.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHen the Citation <hi>Verbal</hi> or <hi>Real,</hi> hath brought a man within the doors of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, there is always cauſe for his detention, if the Friers that are Judges think fit: and if he be indeed any ways tainted or guilty in the matter of Hereſie, he to be ſure is laid up for a good while, except God in mercy releaſe him. Indeed <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> makes mention of ſome who by the Interpoſition of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> or of ſome Princes have been ſet at liberty: And <hi>A Paramo</hi> brings the example of <hi>Laurentius Valla,</hi> who by the Kings command was brought out
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52252:67"/>of the Inquiſition, where he had been condemned to be burnt, and was only whipt with rods in the Dominicans Convent, at <hi>Naples.</hi> But theſe caſes be rare, and generally when a man goes in, he may bid adieu to the world; he muſt meddle no more with the concerns of it, no friends muſt viſit or comfort him, nay, they may not mediate for him, where the Pope is ſupreme, as appears by a Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> V. cited by <hi>Padre Poalo;</hi> ſo that he is left to the mercy of them that think themſelves obliged to have no mercy on him.</p>
               <p>His fare is ſufficient to make him live to feel his miſery. And as <hi>Tho. del Bene,</hi> a very learned Author in theſe matters cites one of the <hi>Clementine Conſtitutions</hi> and other Authors, the Priſon muſt be <hi>durus &amp; arctus,</hi> ſtreight and uneaſie, ſo full of hardſhip and affliction, that it may ſerve <hi>magis ad poenam quam ad cuſtodiam,</hi> rather to puniſh than to ſecure the Priſoner: Yet with this wiſe and moſt gracious caution, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t vita incarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati non abbrevietur notabiliter, ſed tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum aliqualiter,</hi> that the life of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner be not notably, but only indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſhortned. Indeed very few bodies
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52252:68"/>are ſtrong and vigorous enough to bear long with the Calamities of thoſe Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and moſt periſh in them with grief and miſery, eſpecially ſince ſo many Countries ſhook off the Papal Yoke, and prudence and intereſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, that the ſeverities of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſhould not appear bare-faced, as they did do before.</p>

                  <p>BUt for all this, whatever he ſuffers, who deprived of all his former comforts is confined to that moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous reſtraint, he can do nothing to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten his doom, and releaſe by death or pennance. If the Inquiſitors pleaſe he ſhall lie many years (if he can live ſo long) without being ſo much as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, or allowed to ſpeak one word for himſelf. <hi>Caraena</hi> is expreſs, and hath authorities for it, that it is, <hi>In arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio Inquiſitorum quoties &amp; quando reos examinent &amp; conſtituant;</hi>
                     <q>In the choice of the Inquiſitors when and how often they ſhall examine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52252:68"/>and call the Criminals before them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they do, the Regiſter ſets down what is ſaid to them, and what they anſwer; and the firſt thing the Friers do, is to ſwear them upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inſnaring Interrogations, from which if they ever recede afterwards, by forgetfulneſs, or ſharpneſs of pain, they are perjured, and ſuppoſed guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all that is laid to their charge.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Interrogations are ſuch, that no man that is not a thorough-paced Papiſt, can anſwer without betraying himſelf, and his Conſcience muſt hold no Laws but the Popes Will, that can clear himſelf by ſatisfying the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Inquiſitors. Indeed I find that <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> came off with great applauſe, when being brought and queſtioned in the <hi>Holy Office</hi> at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plutum,</hi> and at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> he very brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly acquitted himſelf. It was about the year 1534. when the Reformation had proſpered in many been Kingdoms, and kept out of others, only by vigilant and ſtout cruelty. The Inquiſitors every where were then very ſierce and very jealous, and the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52252:69"/>Founder of the Jeſuits leading a ſtrange unuſual kind of life, and preaching with great vehemence, and very little skill, and no licence at all, became ſuſpect to them; they took him twice, and the laſt time did preſs him ſo home, with about thirty inquiries, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſo poſitively, to their hearts content, that he removed all ſuſpition of his not being a dutiful and true Son of the Roman Church.</p>
                  <p>But to return, the Delinquent brought to anſwer, hath in ſome caſes towards the latter end, a kind of a mock-Advocate, who excepts at formalities, and pleads in the behalf of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſome <hi>Decretals</hi> or <hi>Canons</hi> that can do him no great good. He himſelf, let him anſwer what he will, can neither move his Judges with pity, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to change their uſual way of proceeding. After they have ſworn him upon thoſe Articles that concern his Faith and conſtant adherence to the Roman Church, they will queſtion him about various things, and without taking any notice of it, hear him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deny that ſtoutly of which they have ſufficient proofs; ſuch is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52252:69"/>of man, ſuch is the terrour of that bloudy Court.</p>
                  <p>Here the Friers with their compoſed gravity make long and religious exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the Priſoner at the Bar, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of their good intentions towards him, and that all they do is for the good of his ſoul; tell him they have clear evidence of the whole matter he is charged withal, only that it may profit him, they would have from his own mouth the whole truth in a full and free confeſſion. And when they have ſaid what they will, and heard what his Fears or his Conſcience ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt him, they ſend him back to his Priſon.</p>
                  <p>But if a man at firſt, reſolved to ſave his Soul whatever his Body ſuffers, tells them plainly he is a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to die ſo. Then their promiſes and their threats are all uſed to make him change his mind, and regain him to the Church, and as they ſee cauſe they will haſten or delay his doom, and ſtill ſo order their Methods, as to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their rigours to the hainouſneſs of the Crime of Hereſie.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is a Maxim in the <hi>Jus Pontificium, Haeretico nihil eſt licitum poſſidere,</hi> and this is as good Law as the Pope can make it,
<q>That it is not lawful for a Heretick to poſſeſs any thing.</q> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly when Papal Inquiſitors have judged any man to be ſo, his Eſtate is wholly forfeited. When once he is taken and impriſoned, the <hi>Fiſcalis,</hi> who proſecutes him, demands an Order for the ſecuring of all his Eſtate. If he be the Father of a Family, his Wife and Children can claim nor detain nothing; nay, if it be the Wife that is accuſed, and detained in the Inquiſition, her Husband is deprived of part of what ſhe brought, and muſt be at charge to maintain her, and it is well if it doth not involve him into the ſuſpicion or guilt of Hereſie. Nay, <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro,</hi> is of opinion that a Heretick is bound in Conſcience to give up all his goods to be conſiſcated, before he is accuſed or convicted, and that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52252:70"/>he is unjuſt, and ſins, if he doth not.</p>
                  <p>However all the Inquiſitors and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts are agreed that the Poſſeſſions of a Heretick are all forfeited. <hi>Carro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Jacob. Septim. Gundiſs. de Vill. Franc. Squil,</hi> and many more you may ſee cited by <hi>Gazaros,</hi> who all cite Popes Decretals for it. <hi>Et hoc merito contra Haereticos ſtatutum fuit, ut in egeſtate haeretici laborent, &amp; alii terreantur,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>And this is a juſt Law, (ſaith <hi>Roïas</hi> an Inquiſitor) that Hereticks may be beggarly, and others may be deterred from that crime.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Office</hi> therefore ſends an Order to attach the Heretical goods, and then they become Sacred. No man, for the world dares touch any part of them; then if a man be declared to be an Heretick, whether he recants or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, whether he be burnt or not, his Eſtate is forfeited, and that even from the very hour that he firſt committed the crime of Hereſie; and this breeds many learned queſtions in the Canon-Law. Nay, though the man have been dead many years, and never whilſt he lived queſtioned about his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52252:71"/>Faith, yet he may be declared to have been an Heretick, and his Eſtate ſeized, and by the Pontifician Law declared forfeited. <hi>Poſt Haeretici mortem, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari poteſt eum haereticum fuiſſe ad finem confiſcandi.

                  <p>We need not ſeek far, to find whence ſome Fanaticks took their Tenents of Dominion being founded in grace, and the wicked being Uſurpers of what they poſſeſs, there is enough to this purpoſe among the <hi>Decretals</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagants.</hi> And the <hi>Gloſs,</hi> which is approved notes <hi>in utroque Jure,</hi> ſpeaks it thus plainly;
<q>That Hereticks may juſtly be ſpoiled of what is theirs, and that it is lawful to take from them what they have, though better it were to have it done by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Judge.</q> 
                     <hi>Haeretici recte poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt ſpoliari rebus ſuis, &amp; licitum eſt auferri Haereticis ea quae habent, melius tamen eſt ſi authoritate judicis id fiat. Gl.</hi> 1. <hi>ſum.</hi> 23.4.7.</p>
                  <p>This is very punctually obſerved by the Inquiſitors, who are accountable to none but to the <hi>Apoſtolick Chamber, Benedict</hi> XI. appointed it <hi>anno</hi> 1303. and that the Biſhops ſhould have no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52252:71"/>ſhare, and no power to demand any account of the Inquiſitors, for what they take from Hereticks: yet in the Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King hath one third part, the Inquiſitors one third part, and the other third part is laid by <hi>ad uſus fidei,</hi> for the depreſſing of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and advancing the Popes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.

If the ſenſe of their miſery can ſuffer their thoughts to look out, they ſee what havock is made in their Houſes and Eſtates, what ruine, what danger is brought upon their Families! they themſelves have no conſolations but what they receive from heaven! they are abſolutely in the power of them, who in cold bloud, ſeriouſly and conſcienciouſly will uſe them as barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly as they can, and think they can never exceed in their ſeverity!

               <p>THis is yet more grievous than all that hath been ſaid. If Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks by ſo being have forfeited their Lives and Eſtates, let them be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from them. But why ſhould the unhappy Wretches be tormented with ingenious cruelty: and why ſhould they that judge for God (as they ſay) delight themſelves in the ſhrieks, and groans, and contortions of humane Creatures?</p>
               <p>Indeed I thought that here the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors vizard ſhould have been pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off, and that they would have uſed no longer their godly, or rather canting diſcourſes and formalities, but would have gone about this bloudy work in a bloudy furious manner. But they are ſtill the ſame ſerious godly formal men as before; they ſeem to go about this with as much freedom of thoughts,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52252:74"/>and as good an intention, as ever the Jewiſh Prieſts went about ſlaying of a Calf or Lamb. And I am perſuaded many of them mean well, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly great Caſuiſts, and the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, the moſt vertuous and religious of the Societies of Friers or Jeſuits, that have that great honour and power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them, of being intruſted by the Pope with the management of the <hi>Holy Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then after the Criminal hath been kept as long, and examined as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they pleaſe, the Inquiſitors ſend for him, and having magnified their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long bearing with him, and rehearſed what pains they have taken to make him ſenſible of his guilt, and to bring him to Confeſſion, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, they tell him plainly, that now they are reſolved to have the truth from him, and that being he puts them to it, they muſt uſe the laſt means for that, and come to extremities with him; and that let him look to it, they are reſolved to put him to the torture, ſuch a day and hour, and ſo ſend him back. Let him have ſaid, or let him ſay what he will, it alters not the caſe,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52252:75"/>he muſt ſmart for his Hereſie, and no doubt he is now upon the Rack, his frighted thoughts anticipate the cruel Officers: as no doubt his Judges deſign it, <hi>Laur.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52252:75"/>of the ſacred faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> 1666. treating at large of the Office and Excellencies of the Inquiſition, tells us that leſſer indications or ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of guilt will ſerve in the Caſe of Hereſie, <hi>Leviora indicia ſufficiunt in crimine Haereſis.</hi> And yet thoſe <hi>indicia</hi> are ſo light and comprehenſive, that by them hardly one man ſhall eſcape the ſtretch. Theſe ſix are commonly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in their Directories, 1. <hi>Mala fama,</hi> an ill fame, as it is here with us to be <hi>Popiſhly affected,</hi> whereby certain men would bring all that are not of their Faction under the odium of the People. 2. <hi>Tentata fuga,</hi> if a man hath attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to flee, which any man would, rather than come into their hands. 3. <hi>Locus ſuſpectus,</hi> a ſuſpected place, to have dwelt or been born in a City or Province infected with Hereſie. 4. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> the time, as when there are great endeavours to oppoſe the Romiſh Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Tyranny, then they are to be more cautious, and more ſuſpicious. 5. <hi>Converſatio prava,</hi> a depraved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that is, frequenting ſuch as are tainted or ſuſpect. 6. <hi>Spes commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di alicujus,</hi> the hope of ſome advantage,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52252:76"/>as if a man hath heretical Friends or Relations able to do him good. If a man falls under one or more of theſe ſuſpicions, then he may be proceeded againſt, and urged to confeſs by the Rack; and that eſpecially in the Crime of Hereſie, wherein they all agree that the Inquiſitor muſt be more prone to torture, becauſe that Crime is more ſecret, and lies deep in his heart, or in his underſtanding, and becauſe the confeſſion of it is mighty profitable to the Heretick, <hi>In crimine Haereſis proni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores eſſe debent ad torquendum, quod illud ſit occultum, &amp; quod confeſſio multum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit confitenti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe things duly weighed, and the Inquiſitors having decreed in due form that the man ſhall be put to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſend for him, and very gravely reprove him for his ſhufflings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and abuſing their patience, and putting them to great trouble; and then they afreſh exhort him to unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome all his ſecrets, and for the love of his ſoul and body, to keep back nothing. They tell him how grievous is that which he muſt ſuffer, and that if he ſhould loſe life or limb by it, he muſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52252:76"/>thank himſelf, for their part they muſt do their Office, and it is much againſt their will they are neceſſitated to uſe ſuch means to bring forth the Truth, which he will not confeſs. Such as this and much more to the ſame purpoſe is to be found in their Directories.</p>

                  <p>THe firſt thing that is done is the <hi>Denudatio,</hi> the ſtripping them naked, be they men or women; the <hi>Holy Friers</hi> the while ſitting on their Tribunal, look and are attentive to ſee that every thing be done according to due courſe of Law, and as they ſhall appoint. I find in ſome of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books and Directories mention made of fuſtigation, beating the Criminals with Cudgels upon the bare fleſh. Of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands very ſtreight, <hi>immitten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do virgas inter digitos,</hi> putting ſticks betwixt their fingers.

Of pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in through their Noſtrils water mixed with Lime. And of ſome other kinds of cruelties which I need not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52252:78"/>mention. But the Pulley or ſtretching Rack is that which is moſt generally and frequently uſed, and which their Writers moſt approve. I praiſe God I never ſaw it, but in general they deſcribe the manner of it, thus:</p>
                  <p>After his cloths are pulled off, who is to be tortured, (which is good as they ſay againſt <hi>incantamenta,</hi> Spels and Witchcrafts, which are very frequent in Popiſh Countries, and which are pretended ſo to num ſome Criminals that they feel not the Torture) they put afterwards upon him or her a thin garment of linnen very ſtreight to his limbs. Then with ſmall cords they tie his hand behind him, Wriſt and Thumbs, ſo hard that the bloud guſheth out, and put them upon a hook, which a rope draws up, and hangs him into the air. Then they put weights to his feet, leſs at firſt, and bigger afterwards, till they almoſt diſmember him. Then they pull him up as high as the Judges, who ſit by, are pleaſed to appoint; they ſhake him and pull him down, as the Inquiſitors direct, and keep him thus ſtretched and hanging as long as they command. The while they put queſtions
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52252:78"/>to him, and the Regiſter ſets down his Anſwers. But in the Books that treat of theſe matters, I find this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inſerted, that in queſtioning the Tortured, they ſhould not at all be particular, nor ever ask him expreſly what they would have him ſay: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt only upon generals, that he would ſpeak the truth, and reveal all he knows, leſt (ſay they) the greatneſs of his pain extort from him a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and his impatience make him ſay any thing, that the queſtion ſhould prompt him to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul. Clarus</hi> and <hi>Laur. Arnoldus</hi> direct that the Priſoner ſhould neither eat nor drink for ten hours together before he be tortured, that being more faint and ſooner tired, he may ſooner confeſs, and that clear from fumes, he may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ſpeak his mind more plainly. For what he ſpeaks in the Torture is a good proof in Law againſt himſelf or others, except he preſently retract it, which as ſoon as he is took down they read his confeſſion to him.</p>
                  <p>I find by cautions in ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that ſome weakly, tender Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, not able to bear the pain of it,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52252:79"/>die in the torture, and ſome of them find great fault with it, and in that caſe accuſe thoſe Tortures of cruelty. But however they all own, that it is much worſe to endure the torture, than to have both hands, or any part of the body cut off.</p>

                  <p>IT is ſeldom that once ſerves the turn, and therefore the Judges muſt not be ſatisfied with what the Priſoner ſaith the firſt time he is racked. They have taken great care that Hereticks ſhould not go ſo peaceably out of the world. And therefore the ſame Rules of theirs, that appoint that in the caſe of Hereſie the Inquiſitors ſhould be prone and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to uſe the torture: appoint alſo that he ſhould frequently repeat it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical pravity is a ſubtil and ſecret poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which lies in the cloſeſt receſſes of the Soul, and is apt to ſtick, one bitter potion will not fetch it up, they muſt repeat the Doſe. Therefore when the man is taken down, and they are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52252:79"/>clothing him again, they muſt inſert this clauſe into the Proceſs of what hath been done, <hi>Animo tamen illum torturae iterum ſubjiciendi, quatenus opus ſit;</hi> that now they releaſe him with a deſign to put him again to the ſame torments, as long as there is need.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the poor Wretch, not able to move himſelf, is carried to his Den with this comfort, that as ſoon as his disjoynted bones are knit again, and he is capable of reliſhing the ſame pain, he ſhall be ſure to hear of the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who now will let him alone, but not forget him. But I muſt not forget to ſay, that whilſt he hangs in the Sling with his weights at his feet, thoſe great ſearches of truth, the Inquiſitors, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitis coram eo dirioribus inſtrumentis tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> having ſet before him more dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtruments of torture, give him to underſtand by this formal ſentence, that they will make uſe of them the next time. <hi>Nos Inquiſitores,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>aſſignamus tibi</hi> N.N. <hi>diem talem, ad quaeſtiones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuandum, ut ex tuo ore proprio, veritas ulterior eruatur,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed in ſome of theſe Sentences I find the name of the Biſhop inſerted: but that is only a <hi>pro forma,</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly it is his ſubſtitute, who is, or is ſuppoſed to be then preſent, and who being ſworn to ſecrecy, and to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Inquiſitors is altogether their Servant and their Officer, as are all the reſt of them that attend the <hi>Holy Office.</hi> But for all <hi>Padre Paolo</hi>'s moderation, and his blaming the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies of that Court, I doubt not but at <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelf <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> would be as hardly dealt with, as any where elſe, and that their mixt Inquiſition half Eccleſiaſtical and half Secular would be near as ſevere to real Hereticks, though likely Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks be not ſo much endangered and oppreſſed by it, as in other places. I am ſure that with publick allowance the moſt bloudy Directories of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and the cruelleſt Books againſt Hereticks are Printed at <hi>Venice.</hi> And that for all their own <hi>Patricians</hi> be ſaid to be impowered by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick to inquire againſt Hereſie, the

And therefore let them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge or invent what they will, ſtill they may be tortured further, <hi>in caput alienum,</hi> to diſcover other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or ſtill to ſay more than they have ſaid.

Then is he brought forth, and an Officer of the Court reads his charge and his conviction, which is what they pleaſe to ſay, for the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner muſt not dare to ſpeak one word for himſelf. After that it is declared
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52252:82"/>how it hath pleaſed God to bleſs with ſucceſs the Inquiſitor's endeavours in bringing back the ſtray Sheep into the Fold, and how that the repenting Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, who had been held in the chains of Satan, doth now ſee and bewail the greatneſs of his crime, and begs to be untied from thoſe bonds of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and all other Cenſures, wherewith he was tied, and to be, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any terms re-admitted to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, which requeſt of his they readily accept and grant, out of their great inclination to mercy, they never deſiring the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but only that he may be converted and live.</p>
                  <p>After this, or ſuch a fine Preface, he is abſolved in form, if he was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came out of their Cloyſters; and then they pronounce his Sentence, and after the publick ſolemnity ended, bring him to the Monaſtery back again, that he may have his Penitential Letters, and be fully inſtructed how to behave himſelf for the future.</p>
                  <p>For by their Popes Bulls, and by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors Laws, a man that hath once come into their hands, is never wholly freed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52252:83"/>from them but by death, they may ſtill aggravate his Penance or Puniſhment as they pleaſe, they may at any time take his cauſe in hands again, and have him brought back into their Priſons. They may ſwear whom they pleaſe, to have an eye upon him, to ſee that he wear his <hi>San-benit,</hi> and that he attempt not to go out of the Country.</p>
                  <p>And this they fail not to do, if they ſuſpect the man. And however before his diſmiſſion into the World, the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or the four Walls, they ſtrictly ſwear him to ſecrecy, that he will never reveal to any creature any thing he hath ſeen or known within the Inquiſition, nor any thing that hath been ſaid or done to him. And the Inquiſitors tell him the danger of it, that if he doth, he ſhall be taken for a relaps and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and be dealt with accordingly. Further they ſwear him to the Romiſh Faith, with ſome curſes and imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and many grievous threats, if ever he ſwerves from it, in any one point; and make it part of his Oath, that he ſhall ever diſcover and perſecute Hereticks to the utmoſt of his power,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52252:83"/>and in his Sentence and Abſolution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert this conditional clauſe, <hi>Si de corde bono &amp; de fide non ficta redieritis ad Eccleſiae unitatem, &amp; ſi ſervaveritis illa quae vobis injuncta ſuerint &amp; mandata.</hi>
                     <q>That they are not to receive any benefit by being abſolved, except they (the penitent Hereticks) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the unity of the Church with a good heart, and an unfeigned faith, and obey what ſhall be enjoyned and commanded them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe Cautions and Securities du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved and taken, out goeth the trembling Wretch, reſolved to be ſo zealous a Roman Catholick, as never to come there again by being ſuſpected. But ſome, if before they had known the truth, and cowardly denied it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo perplexed and uneaſie, that they relapſe into Hereſie, and venture the ſeverities of the Inquiſition, and think it eaſier to be racked and burnt, than to bear the accuſations and reproaches of their Conſciences, and venture an eternal Hell.</p>

               <p>IF a man proſecuted by the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or thus reconciled by it, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to flee and be taken, he is a fugitive, by a great mercy they may immure him: but if they ſmell out any Heretical Pravity in the caſe, then muſt he be burnt, he is taken for obſtinate or relaps. And ſo likewiſe if he lets his tongue looſe, and doth tell tales out of the School; if he diſobeys the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Inquiſitors; if he again by word or deed declares he hath ſtill ſome inclination towards Heretical
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52252:87"/>Pravity; or if, notwithſtanding all their pains to inſtruct him better, he ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the profeſſion of what they call Hereſie; in all theſe caſes where they judg a man Relaps or Contumace, he never comes out of their Dungeons but to be tied to the Stake.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more diſpleaſing to him than the conſtancy of a true Chriſtian, who heartily makes confeſſion of all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and declares his reſolution to die in and for that Catholick &amp; Primitive Faith againſt the errors and Innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> After they have as much and as long as they could exerciſed their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties againſt him, and end avoured thereby to bring him to an abjuration of his Faith; then if that doth it not, his Wife and Children and neareſt Friends are to be ſent for, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can move him and ſoften his heart, (as their Directories appoint.) If this alſo be ineffectual, then he is declared convict, and muſt die without redemption.</p>
               <p>Yet ſaith <hi>Carena</hi> and others, <hi>Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio impunitatis Relapſo, non tenet judicem qui promiſit:</hi>
                  <q>They may tempt him

               <p>But it is a judged caſe, as <hi>Nich. Eime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> proves, that when a man hath perſiſted ſo long in his Hereſie, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be truſted, and that though he would profeſs himſelf a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, yet he is to be delivered to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power. And <hi>Dell Bene</hi> is very expreſs, <hi>Nec debet ad poenitentiam ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti qui convertitur jam prolatura ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>That he that is converted when ſentence is ready to be given, muſt never be admitted to any kind of Penance: and that after his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence his fate is yet more irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</q> They may releaſe him of his Excommunication, but yet he ſhall burn.</p>
               <p>All Relaps and Impenitent Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are excommunicated and devoted to damnation before they be delivered up to the Secular power. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the great day comes, which they call <hi>the Act of Faith,</hi> and the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52252:88"/>People are to ſee the ſport, and to be made ſenſible how vile and odious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks are in this world, the Priſoners are brought out into a publick place, commonly into a Cathedral Church. The Penitents bedeckt as I have ſaid before. The Relaps and Impenitents in a more horrid dreſs, with Devils painted upon them, and blaſphemous expreſſions writ about their head, which the crowd is to think they have ſaid. Their tongue is tied, that they may not ſay one word, and that by a prudent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, <hi>leſt they ſhould offend the Ears of the by-ſtanders with their impious Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> as their Doctors have it; <hi>Alligata lingua, ne impiis blaſphemiis offendat aſtantes.</hi> But we could give another reaſon for it, that know what we Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks would be apt to ſpeak in that caſe.</p>
               <p>However in thoſe Countries, it goes down with the ignorant Vulgar, who are taught, above all things, to have the greateſt abhorrence and deteſtation for what their Guides call Hereſie, and to believe the worſt of things of thoſe that are called Hereticks. So that they that are brought to die find little pity
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52252:89"/>among the People, and the Inquiſitors may lay to their charge what they pleaſe, without fear of being disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or diſproved.

And if they ſhould not, they would be excommunicated, and proſecuted with the utmoſt rigour. <hi>Del Bene,</hi> and all their Doctors prove it even by Papal Conſtitutions, <hi>That the Church hath power to put obſtinate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to death.

                     <q>But the Church uſeth not to execute that power by Eccleſiaſtical, but by Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Officers. And the Secular Judge

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the Enormity and further puniſhment of the Crime of Hereſie.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>POſſibly ſome that have frequented perſons of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and have found them courteous and obliging in their Converſe, as many of them are: or ſome that have travelled through ſome Popiſh Countries, and have obſerved nothing of what I here relate, may be tempted to think that theſe cruelties of which we complain are Fables, or were only in the days of old, and now laid aſide: and ſo, that our lives and fortunes would not be in ſuch great danger under a Popiſh Government, as ſome are apt to think.</p>
               <p>But the anſwer is eaſie and plain; that in many perſons of that party, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and natural good diſpoſitions out-weigh the cruel principles of their Religion, which are not approved or
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52252:95"/>followed, not ſo much as known by numbers of them. That however, here amongſt us, whatever they think, and whatever they would do, if they had power, it is not fit nor prudent they ſhould now threaten and tell us the worſt. That abroad, their greateſt cruelties are acted ſecretly, or under a diſguiſe; in ſome Kingdoms where the Popes have long reigned, they cannot now find Hereticks; and in others they are protected by ſecular Princes from the worſt proſecutions of the Papal power. And that whatever any man may have ſeen or not ſeen, yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are fixed and in full force, and as they themſelves tell us, have been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with the utmoſt rigour, at all times and in all places, when and where the Popes have had power and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>It is not what this or that man knows or ſays, that is to be heeded, where there are Laws and ſtanding Rules. Our danger lies in this, that by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we are declared Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; that by the ſame Church, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are declared to be the greateſt, the moſt wicked and vileſt Criminals, who
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52252:95"/>are neither to be pitied nor ſpared. That ſo, that Church diſpoſeth her Members to hate us mortally, and to effect our deſtruction by all poſſible means, nay, and injoyns it, under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties; and that it is ſo, ſtill to this day, both in her Laws, and her practice.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid hitherto, of their proceedings againſt Hereticks, is ſufficient to ſhew that they account He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie a moſt heinous and unpardonable Crime, which they can never puniſh with too great ſeverity in them that are guilty of it, who are not only to ſuffer in their perſons by Racks and Fire, as hath been ſhewed before: but alſo in their Names, Goods, and Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and all that belonged to them. Even the Houſes where they dwelt and taught, are to be thrown down or burnt to aſhes. <hi>Del Bene</hi> and former Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts are very expreſs in it, and have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Decrees for it. And their Sentences in this caſe are of this tenor.</p>

                  <p>SEveral Authors have obſerved with <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> who gives many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, in the firſt Chapter of his <hi>Hiſtory of the Inquiſition,</hi> that the Pope makes a gin of the notions and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Hereſie, and makes his Laws and Declarations about it ſerve the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52252:97"/>ends of his ambition and covetouſneſs; giving the name of Hereticks, not where it is really due, but where he is diſpleaſed, deſirous to conquer, or to ruin his enemies. Heretical pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Romiſh ſenſe, is a thing of which a man may be guilty without his will, and without his knowledge: and yet a thing which makes him the worſt of Traitors againſt the Majeſty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; which expoſeth him here (if the Popes power can reach him) to all the miſery that a human Creature can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and hereafter to damnation. It is not to be thought what Popes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palins have ſaid on this ſubject: and had they not declared us Hereticks, we ſhould have been tempted by what deſcriptions their Writers generally make of Hereticks, to believe them to be the moſt horrid and pernicious Monſters in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Paramo</hi> p. 333. having rehearſed ſome of the wicked pranks of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts in <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> takes occaſion from thence thus to deſcribe all Proteſtants. <hi>Vides plane, Lector, qualia eſſe ſoleant hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticorum opera, qui ſemel exuti Catholicam fidem, omnem cum ea humanitatem, &amp;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52252:97"/>quod proprium eſt hominis rationem pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abjeciſſe videntur, ſuper induentes cum impietate ſaevitiam, prae ſe ferentes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem ejus cujus afflantur ſpiritu, &amp; quo geniti eſſe noſcuntur, diaboli. — Praeter infinita damna quae exitioſa ſta prodigia in orbem terrarum invexerunt, illud certe haud minimum eſt, quod ipſam naturam corruperunt, &amp; laudabiles quarundam nationum mores ita perverterunt atque in pejus permutarunt, ut multi qui ante caſti &amp; pudici erant, temperati ac pene frigidi, ex iſtorum doctrina flagitioſiſſima atque profligatiſſima, ſicut quibuſdam libidinis facibus inflammati. —Enimvero ſic inter Haereticos impura libido &amp; nequitia ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque pervenit ad ſummum ut audeant per impudentiam ſummam pro virtutibus vitia venditare, quod à proteſtantibus fieri palam videmus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Such uſe to be the deeds of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who with the Catholick Faith caſt off all humanity and reaſon, and becoming moſt cruel and impious, bear the image of the devil, of whom they are born, and by whoſe ſpirit they are acted. And this is none of the leaſt miſchiefs which Hereticks, thoſe pernicious Monſters have brought
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52252:98"/>into the world, that they have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature it ſelf, and ſo depraved and changed for the worſt the good manners of ſome Nations, that they have made them infamous brutes in all laſciviouſneſs, who before were exemplary for their chaſtity and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.—for generally among He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, impure luſts and baſe villanies reign in ſuch a degree, that by the higheſt impudence, they own and commend their own vices, as vertues, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do publickly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is ſo much of this in moſt of their Writers, eſpecially in them that treat of Hereſie or the Inquiſition, that I need not multiply quotations.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The greateſt of calamities and ruines brought in by that horrid and deteſtable plague which we call Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, demonſtrate how neceſſary Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be. For ſuch is the guilt of Hereſie, ſuch the funeſt and pernicious nature of it, that it not only deprives men of eternal happineſs, as other mortal ſins, but alſo is the juſt cauſe why Hereticks are puniſhed with loſs of goods and life, why their Books are forbid, they and their Children are deprived of all honours and dignities, and they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from others, by that infamous Veſt which they call <hi>San-benit.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if any man ſhould ask, what is then an Hereſie, which they make ſo wicked and ſo criminal, after all theſe hard words and hard uſages, they will ſay, that <hi>it is an error in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with obſtinacy in the Will.</hi> That is, that a man will adhere to what he is perſuaded to be truth, though others deny it. This, one would think, ſhould not be ſo heinous, nor ſo dreadful as they make it: but then the matter is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52252:99"/>that which offends them moſt. <hi>Haereſis eſt circa pertinentia ad fidem, vel contra determinationem Eccleſiae, de rebus ad fidem vel ad mores pertinentibus.</hi> This is their uſual definition of an Hereſie,
<q>That it is about matters of Faith, or againſt the determinations of the Church, concerning what we ſhould believe, or what we ſhould do.</q> And ſo here comes their Romiſh Creed, which you have <hi>p.</hi> 4. And here they bring in, (as they have ſtrength and opportunity) all Papal Conſtitutions and Decrees. And their Canon Law ſaith, <hi>Haereticus reputatur qui ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſummi Pontificis juſtum, venerabiliter non recipit;</hi>
                     <q>That he is reputed an Heretick who doth not reverently obey the juſt Laws of the Pope.</q> And that they are all ſo, the <hi>Jus Pontificium</hi> is very peremptory and plain. <hi>Papa ſi aliquid facit quod videtur injuſtum, ubi nos non poſſumus rationem aſſignare, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilominus juſtum eſt.</hi> And the Gloſs. <hi>Papa quod approbat, non licet alicui re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probare.</hi>
                     <q>That whatever the Pope doth is juſt, though it ſeems other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and we can give no reaſon for it: and that it is not lawful for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52252:99"/>any to reprove what he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the great Hereſie of all, is to oppoſe the Popes Will in any matter, or upon any account; hence comes the great malignity of Heretical opinions and practices. And for all they charge Hereticks with ſuch vile immoralities, that one would think the very ſight of them ſhould create horror in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, yet they tell us plainly,
<q>That though they live well, yet they ſhall be damned; and that they are the more to be ſhunned and hated.</q>

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>Of ſeveral Inflictions upon Hereticks.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Wit and Invention and Policy of <hi>Rome</hi> hath appeared in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than in her methods and proceedings againſt ſuch as have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted her abſolute ſovereignty in all things. Nothing is left unattempted that can depreſs and ruin them: and her making them Hereticks, <hi>i. e.</hi> moſt impious Prevaricators againſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath been an effectual means for the deſtroying of them. This hath ingaged the zeal of the Vulgar, (all men coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Religion moſt Sacred) and hath been the white Veil, wherewith ſhe hath covered her blackeſt Deſigns. So we find the Romiſh Party, when they treat of theſe matters, laying all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aggravations upon what they call Hereſie: and making it the greateſt Treaſon and Rebellion againſt Heaven, infer from thence, That it being the moſt publick and moſt heinous crime,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52252:100"/>all Chriſts Subjects, who are concerned for his honour, are bound to proſecute and revenge it. The <hi>Jus Pontificium</hi> and the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> have this frequently: <hi>Illius diſſimulare non debemus opprobria, qui probra noſtra delevit: &amp; ſi contra ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines illatae blaſphemiae impune non tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeunt, multo magis qui ipſum ſalvatorem noſtrum blaſphemat, dignus eſt ſupplicia ſuſtinere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Accordingly they have writ, decreed, and inflicted on thoſe whom they have pleaſed to call Hereticks, that even after their death their bones ſhould be took up and burnt with this preamble in the Sentence, <hi>Attendentes quod cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haereſis propter ſuam immanitatem &amp; enormitatem, non ſolum in vivis, ſed &amp; in mortuis, per jura promptiſſima debeat vindicari, Nos</hi> N. <hi>Inquiſitores,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the crime of Hereſie is ſo vaſt and enormous, that with the ſpeedieſt juſtice it ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, not only here on the living, but even in the grave on them that are dead, We therefore <hi>N.</hi> Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> As Hereticks have no ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when dead, ſo living every man is bound to accuſe them. <hi>Quiſquis tenetur
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52252:101"/>Haereticum non tantum denunciare, ſed etiam accuſare;</hi> which they prove out of <hi>Deut.</hi> Chap. 13.

                     <q>That every Catholick may lawfully apprehend Hereticks, ſpoil them of their goods and kill them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So many of them ſay, that a Prieſt may break the Seal of Confeſſion, to reveal an Heretick, <hi>Quia ille non agit poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiam, &amp; quia tali non eſt fides ſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi>
                     <q>Becauſe no faith is to be kept to an Heretick, and becauſe, he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impenitent there is no Sacrament of Penance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, <hi>Civitas tota poteſt igne deſtrui, quando in ea plures Haeretici.</hi>
                     <q>That a whole City may be burnt down, when Hereticks in it are too numerous,</q> which is proved by <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.16.</p>
                  <p>Item, <hi>Contractum aliquem vel pactum validum Haereticus celebrare non valet,

                     <q>An Heretick can make no Contract of any worth, and any engagement or promiſe made to him, is void and of no force, though it were confirmed with an Oath.</q>

                  <p>Item, <hi>Qui ſepelit mortuum excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatum, in excommunicationem incidit, ctiamſi tantum ſyndone tegat.</hi>
                     <q>He falls under Excommunication that buries an excommunicated perſon, or but puts him up in a Winding-ſheet.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, <hi>Haereticus ipſo jure eſt excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatus, traditus Satanae ut ab eo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queatur, &amp; eandem poteſtatem habet dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus in excommunicato, quam ruſticus in pecore ſuo.</hi>
                     <q>An Heretick is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate by the Law, without a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and is delivered up to Satan to be tormented, and the devil hath

                  <p>Item, <hi>Haeretici ſunt deterioris condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis quam Juaedi.</hi>
                     <q>Hereticks are in a worſe condition than Jews.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, <hi>Papae neutiquam obediendum ſi aliquid praecipiat, quod ſit in favorem Haereticorum.</hi>
                     <q>The Pope is not to be obeyed, where he commands any thing in favour of Hereticks.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, <hi>Sola voluntas vel cogitatio puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in crimine Haereſis.</hi>
                     <q>The Will alone, or but the Thoughts, without any outward Act, is puniſhed in the Crime of Hereſie.</q>
                  </p>

                     <q>Though Hereſie be a Capital Crime, which incurs the ſhedding of bloud, yet there is no pardoning of it, nor no treating about leſſening of its puniſhment, for it is ſuch an offence as none but God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, <hi>Quia Haereticus eſt hoſtis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis, ideo licet cuique illum propria

                     <q>An Heretick being a common enemy, it is lawful for every one to kill him, much more to take him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, <hi>Delictum Haereſis etiam igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranter prolatum gravius eſt quam doloſum homicidium.</hi>
                     <q>An Heretical word ſpoken through ignorance is a more grievous crime than wilful murther, murther, becauſe the Heretick ſets his face againſt heaven.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, <hi>Haeretici tanquam animalia ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenoſa &amp; peſtifera, antequam virus evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſunt puniendi.</hi>
                     <q>Hereticks, like Serpents and Toads, muſt be puniſhed before they ſpue their venom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſaith the Popes <hi>Extravagants, Haeretici primo ſunt admonendi, poſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidendi; &amp; Haeretici utiliter patiuntur quod Catholici utiliter inferunt.</hi>
                     <q>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks muſt firſt be admoniſhed, and then killed. And it is profitable for them to ſuffer, what of duty Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks inflict upon them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Volumes of Collections might be made of this. That Hereticks may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy nothing of thoſe rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that belong to human Creatures, and that they muſt be afflicted and

                  <p>EXcommunication in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may be incurred upon ſo many accounts, that there is hardly one of Ten, among the beſt Romaniſts, that is not <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> or <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. It is true, that commonly in their Abſolutions they take off thoſe bonds indefinitely: but yet the danger is ſo great of coming any ways under the direful Sentence, that it mightily expoſeth Magiſtrates to be thus ſmitten like others by the Papal Fulminations. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath provided <hi>Sect. ult.</hi> that <hi>whoever after admonition, remains for a whole year excommunicate, ſhall be reputed Heretick, and proceeded againſt as ſuch.</hi> Here Sovereign Princes have no exemption.

                  <p>But what then? What if they are excommunicate, and reputed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks?

                     <q>The Pope hath the place of Chriſt upon earth, and his will is ſaid to be the will of heaven.</q> Item, <hi>Papa eſt ſuper omnes homines, &amp; ei obedire eſt de neceſſitate ſalutis.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. IV. <hi>Of the Authorities and Authors uſed in this Book.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MOſt of what hath been ſaid of the proceedings of the Popes and the Inquiſition againſt Hereticks and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Princes, is to be met with in ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52252:106"/>many Authors, and with ſo little varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and recurrs ſo often, that to bring quotations for every particular, would have ſwelled and crowded my Margin to no purpoſe at all: when it may do as well here to name thoſe Books which will prove what I have alledged. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt of it is ſo unreaſonable, ſo ſtrange and inhuman, that to men of a good temper it will look like the Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a malicious and a melancholy brain. Did many that are in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believe it to be guilty of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Principles, and bloudy Practices, as are here mentioned, they would be mightily ſtaggered in their belief of its being the pure and only Church of Chriſt, and ſome would forſake and even deteſt the communion of that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs perſecuting party, who now with a good zeal follow it, and think to go right.</p>
                  <p>Many Proteſtants alſo would be mightily confirmed in that Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed among us, and would be more thankful for being delivered from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Roman yoke, if they knew how heavy and intolerable it was to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52252:106"/>ſuch of our Forefathers, as ſaw the Truth, and deſired to follow it.</p>
                  <p>I know it is objected, that we have thoſe amongſt us, who are very froward and ſeditious towards their Governours, and upon Rebellious Principles have done very vile things: But it is our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs and our grief; our eſtabliſhed Church and Religion are hated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by them, and were by them altered and ruined when they had power; and it is clear as the light, that they have their ill Principles out of thoſe very Roman Schools which they ſeem ſo much to abhor. In them are taught at large thoſe opinions which make Diſſenters bad Subjects, and thoſe which countenance the uſurpations of the Popes, and the cruelties of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>
                  <p>I profeſs that what I have laid down as their Tenents or Practices, I have had from their own Authors: and that in them I have conſulted, there is vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more, and ſometimes worſe than what I have extracted. I ſhall be amply juſtified, as to the faithfulneſs of what account I give of the Papal and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory proceedings againſt Hereticks,

But in that vaſt Collection of the <hi>Pontificial Law,</hi> Printed at <hi>Venice,</hi> you have many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors inſerted, who treat at large of all things relating to Hereticks, wherein a man may fully inform himſelf of thoſe Writers I have but lightly touched.</p>
                  <p>I cite ſome <hi>Bulls</hi> that are in the <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larium</hi> of <hi>Laërce Cher.</hi> and other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections ſince. But to ſave the labour of ſearching into great Volumes, <hi>Aloiſ. Bariola</hi> and <hi>Franc. Pegna</hi> have made a Collection in quarto of above an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Bulls, ſince the beginning of the Reformation, to injoyn, direct, and encourage the extirpation of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, all manner of ways, but eſpecially by the Inquiſition.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſome might ſay, Who regards old Bulls or Decretals? And what do moſt of them ſignifie that have been long out of date? We muſt know, that every thing is in force, that makes againſt Hereticks. That we may not flatter our ſelves, <hi>Canoniſts</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52252:107"/>tell us, <hi>Extravagantes in corpore juris non clauſae, contra haereticos editae, ſunt validae, ſi conſtitutionibus in corpore juris regiſtratis, contra haereticos, non obvient.</hi> That is,
<q>That all thoſe Laws and Papal preſcripts new or old, ſome forged, ſome of uncertain Authors, that are not digeſted into order, and have no proper place aſſigned to them in the Body of the Canon, are of force, as far as they make againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and moderate or oppoſe none of the more Canonical Conſtitutions that are againſt them.</q> And we know how ſtrictly they are executed where the Pope is obeyed: and how general that execution would be if he might have his will. There is a Bull of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV. <hi>anno</hi> 1558. whereby he very ſtreightly commands, <hi>Renovari &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violabiliter obſervari omnes leges, decreta ſive ſtatuta à Romanis Pontificibus, ſacris conciliis &amp; ſanctorum Patrum decretis, in haereticos &amp; ſchiſmaticos quovis tempore edita, etiamſi in literis Pontificum extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantibus contineantur,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>That all Laws, Decrees, and Statutes, made at any time by Roman Popes, ſacred Councils, or holy Fathers, againſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52252:108"/>Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, ſhould be renewed and inviolably obſerved, even ſuch as are among thoſe <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> which they call <hi>Extravagants.</hi> And he commands further, that if they have been upon any account diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed or neglected, they ſhould now be revived, and brought into uſe again; and that they ſhould be ſtrictly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and executed againſt all perſons whatſoever, without regard to their greatneſs or dignity.</q> If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be in earneſt, we ſee what would become of us, and of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes, had he thoſe that could or would put his Sentence in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>Theſe publick, and in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> higheſt Authorities, give grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force and credit to thoſe leſſer ones of private Writings, which are licenſed and allowed: and are, as it were but Comments upon the Text; Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the practice of the Church, that her Laws are taught and obeyed, ſo that all thoſe <hi>Inquiſitors, Fiſcalis's, Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Holy Office,</hi> and <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> which have written about the Crime and puniſhment of Hereſie, are to be

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of ſeveral things that conduce to make the Inquiſition powerful and glorious.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HEreſie being ſo vile, ſo execrable a thing, and Hereticks ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and odious, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily magnified thoſe perſons and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſerve againſt them. The Pope who is the great keeper and maker of their Faith is exalted above all right and Laws, and all created things. <hi>In his quae vult, pro ratione vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem habet, 5.</hi> the <hi>Gloſs.</hi> His Will ſtands for Reaſon, and a ſufficient one, in whatſoever he hath a mind to do. And ſo abſolute and uncontrolable is his Dominion that he cannot be tied to any thing, not ſo much as by himſelf. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa non poteſt legem ſibi imponere, à qua ſibi recedere non liceat;</hi> his own word hath no power to bind him. And as for others the <hi>Text</hi> ſaith, <hi>Papa à nemine
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52252:109"/>judicari poteſt, nec ulli contra eum ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam proferre licet.</hi> There is on earth no Judg, nor Tribunal above the Pope.</p>
               <p>Inquiſition by the ſame Rule, is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced next to him, for it is, ſaith the Law, <hi>Inventum in augmentum fidei, d. Clem.</hi> 1. found out and ſet up for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and propagation of the Faith. And it is a maxim in their ſpiritual Courts, <hi>Citatus ab Epiſcopo &amp; Inquiſitore, prius Inquiſitori pareto.</hi> That the Inquiſition muſt be obeyed before the Biſhop. But how ſhould Prelates be regarded, when even ſovereign Princes, who under God ſhould be Maſters of the world, are, as far as lies in the power of the Roman Court, made to truckle under the Papal and Inquiſitory Empire, in all caſes wherein Faith and Hereſie are concerned.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Spondanus ad ann.</hi> 1460. tells us, that there is a Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> II. whereby he damns as Traitors and Hereticks, all that ſhould preſume to appeal from the Sentence of the Pope, to the next Council, <hi>though they were Kings or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.</hi> And there is a Decree of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> III. <hi>anno</hi> 1551. againſt them that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52252:110"/>ſhould any ways hinder the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Inquiſition, or that admit Lay-men to be Judges in the Caſe of Hereſie, which he concludes thus brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Quicunque monitis his noſtris non obtemperaverint, noverint ſe, non ſolum per ſacras praedeceſſorum noſtrorum conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutiones, verumetiam per hanc noſtram ſanctionem ſive ſententiam &amp; declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem perpetuo duraturam, quam auctoritate omnipotentis Dei ac Beatorum Apoſtolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Petri &amp; Pauli, ac noſtra, in ipſos non obtemperantes, quacunque illi praeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant dignitate, in his ſcriptis proferimus, communione Fidelium &amp; omnium ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentòrum perceptione privatos ac male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis, ac execrationis aeternae ligatos, Anathematiſque &amp; majoris excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis mucrone percuſſos.</hi>
                  <q>Whoever ſhall not obey theſe our Precepts, whatever dignity they are of, let them know that, by the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Predeceſſors, and by the Sanction and Sentence which we bear in theſe preſents, to endure for ever againſt all diſobedients, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Almighty God, of the Bleſſed Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and of our own, they are deprived of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52252:110"/>the Communion of the Faithful, and of the receiving any Sacraments, and are bound over to eternal Curſe and Execration, and ſtruck with the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Anathema's of the greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Pius</hi> V. <hi>anno</hi> 1569. hath a long <hi>Bull</hi> againſt all perſons whatever that ſhould do any wrong or injury to any thing or perſon belonging to the <hi>Moſt Holy Office,</hi> (as he calls it) which he mightily magnifies and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, giving this reaſon for it. <hi>Si de protegendis caeteris omnibus Eccleſiae Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtris — quanto majore ſtudio eam nos ſolicitudinem capeſſere neceſſe eſt, ut qui in ſacro Inquiſitionis Haereticae pravitatis officio verſantur, ſub tutela inviolatae auctoritate hujus ſedis, periculorum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um expertes quaeque munera ad exaltatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem fidei Catholicae exequantur,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>If we are obliged to protect all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church, with how much more zeal and carefulneſs ought we to endeavour, that they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Sacred Office of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition againſt Heretical pravity, ſhould be inviolably defended from all dangers under the authority of

And therefore beſides this Hectoring of the Pope in their behalf, whereever Inquiſition is ſet up, all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Officers are obliged to ſwear, <hi>that they will perſecute Hereticks with all their power, and will be obedient to God, to the Roman Church, and to the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors.</hi>

                  <p>INquiſitors are called, <hi>Defenſores fidei &amp; Eccleſiae, ad gloriam Dei &amp; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum fidei deputati.</hi> Defenſors of the Faith of the Church, deputed for the glory of God, and the increaſe of holy Faith. They have power at any time to grant Indulgences of forty days, and of three years to them who any ways are aſſiſtants againſt Hereticks. They themſelves have granted by three Popes as <hi>Aimericus</hi> in his <hi>Directorium</hi> tells us, <hi>Plenary Indulgences and a full Pardon of all their ſins both living and dying.</hi> So that if they are exorbitant
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52252:112"/>in the uſe of their power, and chance to wound their Conſciences, here is a ſure Plaiſter near at hand.</p>
                  <p>They being accountable to none but to the Pope, whoſe Delegats they are, and having power to proceed againſt all ſorts of perſons, even againſt the Secular and Regular Clergy, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all exemptions, as <hi>Villa-Diego</hi> cites the Canon Law. <hi>Pro cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Haereſis poſſunt procedere contra om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes etiam exemptos,</hi> &amp;c. have therefore a mighty influence over all Confeſſors, and by their means over all people, who either living or dying, are ſo awed by them that can give or deny Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that where the Inquiſition prevails, the Popes Edicts are of more force, than any Civil Laws or Evangelical Precepts. <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> chap. 26. gives an inſtance of it very obſervable. And <hi>A Paramo</hi> p. 623, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith, that in their Viſitations, when the Inquiſitors pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their <hi>Edict of Juſtice,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all Confeſſors to make what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries they pleaſe, and forbid them to abſolve any penitents from any thing that concerns Hereſie. And they enjoyn all under ſevere penalties, to declare
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52252:113"/>who they are that have, or have read any Bibles in the Vulgar Tongue, or any Heretical Books, or have revealed any ſecret of the Inquiſition, or ſpoken any thing againſt it, or not obeyed their Injunctions. Which makes their Dominion more formidable and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, than that of Turkiſh Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen before how they have a numerous train of armed men, who have power always and in all places to wear all ſorts of Weapons, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to their ſervice and obedience. Now theſe men as well as their Maſters are ſacred and inviolable, as appears by the fore-mentioned Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> V. But <hi>Leo</hi> X. had before that, <hi>anno</hi> 1515. ordered that whoever ſhould kill, beat, or ſtrike any of them, ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to the Secular Power to be burnt as a Heretick.</p>
                  <p>It would be endleſs to rehearſe all their priviledges and powers which make the Tribunal of a few (in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance) contemptible Friers, higher, more firm, more irreſiſtible and dreadful, than that of any Potentate upon earth. Their Myſtick Coat of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52252:113"/>Arms repreſents much of this, as ſome make it out very ingeniouſly. A green Croſs in Field Sable, on the right ſide a green Olive branch, on the left a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked glittering Sword and a Brier; round the Croſs this Motto, <hi>Exurge Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, judica cauſam tuam,</hi> which is <hi>ver.</hi> 23. of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.</p>
                  <p>But Torrents of Bloud and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Flames had been more proper, to repreſent what uſe they make of their might. Out of their own Writings, and other Authors, ſince the time of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> a man might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a diſmal Catalogue of men of Fame, Learning, and Piety, whom they have by various torments murthered in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdoms for being Hereticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Millions known only to themſelves, whom they have likewiſe deſtroyed. <hi>A Paramo</hi> tells us of more than thirty thouſand burnt in <hi>Sicily</hi> in leſs than 150. years, under pretence of being Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. That in <hi>Portugal, Didacus de Sylva</hi> being ſupreme Inquiſitor, ſo many, and ſome even of the principal men, were miſerably haraſſed, impriſoned, bound, tortured, condemned, that about the year 1535. the King was
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52252:114"/>mightily affected with pity, and with much ado ſtopt and reverſed thoſe bloudy proceedings. And the ſame Author cites <hi>Hieronimus Zurita</hi> to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that in a few years, more than one hundred thouſand in <hi>Sevil</hi> alone, were ſeveral ways put to death, and that more than five thouſand houſes remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed empty, for a great while.</p>
                  <p>But it would no doubt exceed much all other accounts, and be the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, if the Regiſters of the Inquiſition for the two laſt hundred years ſhould come to publick view, and we could ſee in them the numbers of men they have ſlain, and the ſorts of tortures they have made them endure, that were, or were ſuſpected to be, ſuch Hereticks as we.</p>

                     <hi>Thuanus</hi> in <hi>l.</hi> 3. giving an account of the great prevalency of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrine, even in <hi>Italy,</hi> and how the Tyranny of the Inquiſition was let looſe upon all that but looked towards it, gives this ſhort account of that <hi>Holy Tribunal, Ejus horror &amp; odium ingens — augebat horrorem perverſa &amp; praepoſtera judiciorum forma, quae contra naturalem aequitatem &amp; omnem legitimum ordinem,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52252:114"/>in juriſdictione illa explicanda obſervatur; tum etiam immanitas tormentorum, quibus plerunque contra veritatem quicquid dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis judicibus libebat, à miſeris &amp; inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centibus reis, ut ſe cruciatibus eximerent, per vim extorquebatur.</hi> That is,
<q>That it is the object of the greateſt dread and hatred, becauſe the method of its proceedings is againſt all Order, and Juſtice, and natural Equity, and becauſe by direful unnatural tortures, the Judges make innocent Criminals ſuffer and ſay what they pleaſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know there have been Maſſacres and bloudy Executions in many places where there is no Inquiſition. In <hi>France</hi> many Towns of the poor <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were deſtroyed, and the Inhabitants, Men, Women, and Children moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murthered, <hi>Thuan. l.</hi> 6. The <hi>Pariſian</hi> St. <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> ſome years after, is alſo ſadly remarkable; what hapned ſince here and elſewhere upon the ſame account, cannot be forgotten. The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit <hi>Strada l.</hi> 2. ſaith, that beſides thoſe that ſuffered under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſeverities ſhe uſed to purge this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Hereſie, drove away no leſs than thirty thouſand perſons out of it.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52252:115"/>How many in leſſer numbers, endured great perſecutions, and died at the the Stake, for many years, in moſt places of <hi>Europe</hi> where the Popiſh Religion and Power had the prevalency, is known only to that God who hears the voice of Innocent bloud, and is the Revenger of it, though many Authors have tranſmitted to Poſterity large me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of thoſe cruelties, ſome in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, ſome in commendation of them.</p>
                  <p>What hapned in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> where <hi>Philip</hi> II. by fire and ſword and great violence for the eſtabliſhing of the Spaniſh Inquiſition provoked the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their own defence to undertake that long and bloudy War which coſt him ſeven Provinces.
<note place="margin">Thuanus.</note> What was done in <hi>France</hi> againſt the two <hi>Henries,</hi> by that rebellious League, which the Pope abetted, and which undertook to ſet up his authority, Inquiſition, and Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Council: Theſe two memorable attempts in the behalf of Papal Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt Heretical pravity, have ſhed ſo much Chriſtian bloud, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that very power and Tribunal, they were deſigned to promote, have

And I am of opinion, that were all things duly conſidered and compared, it would clearly appear, that there have been as great ſlaughters, outrages, inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities committed, as many Martyrs made by <hi>Rome</hi> Papiſt, ſince <hi>Dominic</hi> and the Inquiſition appeared, as was done by <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, in the Ten Perſecutions for three hundred years.

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>Of the prohibiting of Books, and the</hi> Indices expurgatorii.</head>
                  <p>AMong the many priviledges of the Inquiſitors, it is none of the leaſt, that the Cenſure of Books belongs to them, whereever they have a Tribunal; by which means they keep the People in as much ignorance as they pleaſe, and furniſh the learned with none but ſuch Books as tend to eſtabliſh the Roman
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52252:116"/>Faith, and their own Authority. For theſe two, there being in thoſe Popiſh Countries ſo very many Books, ſo fierce and poſitive, and none appearing to contradict them, it is no wonder if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ranks lie under great, invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible prejudices in thoſe Points that are diſputed betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether ſuch as concern the Faith, or the Power of the Magiſtrates, or thoſe common Rights of humanity which belong to all mankind; where we and our opinions are repreſented as very monſtrous and pernicious, and there are publick Schools and Lectures of cruelty againſt us, and a great part of the learning is to know the accurate and eſtabliſhed methods of deſtroying Hereticks; and men are acquainted with nothing but what makes for the Papal Power and Dominion, and theſe things are inculcated and taught with great aſſiduity and great induſtry, and a very ſtrict watch is had againſt all Perſons, Books, or Opinions that could any ways thwart or oppoſe thoſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Maxims: it muſt needs have a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty influence upon the minds and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of men. The Officers of the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52252:116"/>Inquiſition, who have nothing elſe to do, are ſo numerous, powerful, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, and diligent, that it is matter of the greateſt danger and difficulty to print or import any Books, that ſhould ſavour of what they call Hereſie, or maintain the juſt rights of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes againſt the Spiritual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
                  <p>For this laſt, ſaith the Judicious <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre Paolo, When a Potentate hath not the favour of him that commands in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical cauſes, Religion is made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to oppreſs him.</hi> Of which he gives inſtances <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. and amongſt them, that when the Pope was fallen out with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> any Books that came out in Favour of the Republick, were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Papal Inquiſitions, under colour of Hereſie. It is but giving any thing hard and terrible names, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all things that can be ſaid in the defence of it, and then it will be eaſie to impoſe on the People.</p>
                  <p>Relating to this I ſhall tranſcribe out of the laſt mentioned Author part of <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. <hi>The matter of Books ſeems to be a thing of ſmall moment, becauſe it treats of words; but through theſe words come
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52252:117"/>opinions into the world, which cauſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities, Seditions, and finally Wars; they are words, it is true, but ſuch, as in conſequence draw after them Hoſts of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men.</hi> —<q>By forbidding Books which at <hi>Rome</hi> are not liked of, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be good and godly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they maintain Temporal Power, great wrong is done to Sovereign Princes, to ſuch eſpecially as would rule with the Arts of Peace, who uſe Books as a chief Inſtrument to cauſe people to believe as a firm truth, that the Prince is Ordained by God, and Ruleth with Divine Authority, and the Subject conſequently in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is bound to obey him, and not doing it offendeth God, becauſe that the Prince, by the Law of God, is above every perſon that is within his Dominions, and may lay burthens on mens Eſtates, as publick neceſſities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Where theſe things, which are moſt true, are believed, a State may eaſily be governed: but where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions are held, great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders muſt needs happen. But as there was always in Gods Church, thoſe who made uſe of Religion for worldly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52252:117"/>ends, ſo the number of them is more full. Theſe under a ſpiritual pretence, but with an ambitious end, and deſire of worldly wealth, would free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the obedience due unto the Prince, and take away the love and reverence due to him by the people, to draw it to themſelves. To bring it to paſs, they have newly invented a Doctrine, which talks of nothing but Eccleſiaſtical greatneſs, liberty, immunity, and juriſdiction. This Doctrine was unheard of, until about the year 1300. Neither is there any Book concerning it, before this time, then did they begin to write of it ſcatteringly in ſome Books, but there were not above two Books which treated of nothing elſe but this, until the year 1400. and three until the year 1500. After this time the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber encreaſed a little, but it was tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. After the year 1560. this Doctrine began to encreaſe in ſuch manner, that they gave over writing, as they uſed before, of the Myſteries of the Moſt Holy Trinity, of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Chriſt, of the Creation of the World, and other Myſteries of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52252:118"/>the belief, and there is nothing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Italy,</hi> but Books in diminution of Secular Authority, and exaltation of the Eccleſiaſtical; and ſuch Books are not Printed by ſmall numbers, but by thouſands: Thoſe people which have learning, can read nothing elſe; the Confeſſors likewiſe know none other Doctrine, neither need they any other Learning to be approved of. Whence comes in a perverſe opinion univerſally, that Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are human Inventions, yea, and Tyrannical, that they ought only by compulſion to be obeyed; that the diſobeying of Laws, and defrauding the publick Revenues doth not bind unto ſin, but only unto puniſhment. And contrariwiſe, that every beck of Eccleſiaſtical perſons, ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a divine Precept, and binds the Conſcience; and this Doctrine is perhaps the cauſe of all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which are felt in this Age.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we may ſee (as I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) whence the diſloyal and factious Principles of our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> come; and by whoſe inſtigation they likely have
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52252:118"/>been moved to act as they have done.</p>
                  <p>Our Author adds,
<q>That as they condemn and perſecute Books that come out in the behalf of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, ſo they geld the Books of ancient Authors, by new Printing them, and taking out of them all that which might ſerve for Temporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What he ſaith of Books that concern the Government, is moſt true alſo of them that concern their Religion or new Creed. Not one Book, Ancient or Modern, is ſuffered to ſpeak one ſyllable againſt any thing that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth teach or practiſe, though they be ſuch as are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged even by learned men of their Communion to be corrupt or ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And Book that might open the eyes of the People is, without fail, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited or gelded: Even the Holy Bible, as a dangerous Book, that favours He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, is ſtreightly forbidden the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as we have ſeen before in the ſevere Edict of the Inquiſitors.</p>
                  <p>There are now great variety of thoſe <hi>Indices,</hi> or Catalogues of Books for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52252:119"/>or of things to be taken out of them. Every year likely their comes out one, commanded to be admitted and obeyed in all the Chriſtian world. Where there are Inquiſitors thoſe <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> are ſent to them, who enjoyn all Confeſſors to take care about them in their confeſſing and abſolving their Penitents. And by this means they not only keep from the people all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive good Books: but they ſo mangle and alter thoſe Books which they cannot keep out of their hands, <hi>that at preſent, in reading of a Book, a man can no more find what the Authors meaning was, but only what is the meaning of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>who hath altered every thing,</hi> as famous <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> complains and ſhews at large.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe <hi>Indices</hi> publiſhed firſt by <hi>Junius,</hi> and afterwards even by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and licence we have this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment ſpeaking of <hi>Bertrams</hi> Book. <hi>In old Catholick Writers, we ſuffer many Errors, and extenuate and excuſe them, and by ſome device we feign ſome convenient ſenſe, when they are oppoſed to us. Excogitato Commento, ſenſum iis affingimus.</hi> And we have theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52252:119"/>in <hi>Indices,</hi> Text or Marginal Notes of ſeveral Authors, which were to be purged and left out in the next Editions, as being heretical or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Doctrines. <hi>Deus ſolus adorandus,</hi> God alone is to be worſhipped. <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enis meritis &amp; operibus nemo juvatur;</hi> No man is benefited by the merits or good works of another. <hi>Habitat Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus per fidem in cordibus noſtris;</hi> Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith. <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens Chriſto non morietur in aeternum;</hi> He that believeth in Chriſt ſhall not die eternally. <hi>Juſtus coram Deo nemo;</hi> No man is juſt before God. <hi>

Sancta Dei Eccleſia creaturam non adorat;</hi> The Holy Church of God worſhips no Image. <hi>A Deo ſolo omnia petenda;</hi> every thing is to be demanded of God alone by Prayer. Theſe, and many the like, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are in the Authors themſelves, and ſome in holy Writ expreſly, yet are to be blotted out, as not agreeing with Roman Catholiciſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> obſerves, that they not only take away what they like not, but
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52252:120"/>that they alſo add what makes for their purpoſe. I am ſure by the Inſtructions of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. if they be duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, Books, that paſs through the hands of the Inquiſition, muſt become as correct and infallible as his Holineſs himſelf. He directs and enjonys the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, and thoſe whom they ſhould appoint, to repurge Authors that want it, <hi>ann.</hi> 1596. <hi>Qui negotium ſuſceperit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigendi atque expurgandi, circumſpicere &amp; attente notare debet, non ſolum quae in curſu operis manifeſte ſe offerunt, ſed ſi quae in ſcholiis, in ſummariis, in marginibus, in indicibus librorum, in praefationibus, aut Epiſtolis dedicatoriis, tanquam in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiis deliteſcunt.</hi> That is,

                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe are ſome of the things which he ſaith want a purgation of Ink. <hi>Poſitiones erroneae, ſchiſmaticae, haereticae, haereſim ſapientes. — quae contra ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum ritus &amp; ceremonias, contra re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum

And all ſuch doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ambiguous words as may draw the minds of Readers from the right Catholick ſenſe to naughty opinions. Words of Holy Writ not well ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or taken from heretical ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, except they be intended to ſerve againſt Hereticks, to cut their throats with their own weapons.

                  </p>
                  <p>Heretical pravity muſt needs be mighty ſtubborn and incurable in thoſe Authors that will not be purged and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52252:121"/>made ſound Roman Catholicks by theſe and the like Preſcriptions, of which there are good ſtore, made ſince by other Popes. Whereby we may ſee how we are to truſt the faith and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the infallible Church, and what credit is to be given to Writers of that Communion, when they treat of any matters that concern Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                  <p>Now in <hi>the Rules of the Sacred Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, anno</hi> 1667. publiſhed by the Authority of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. the former Injunctions are confirmed, and they expreſly ſet down in the Index of prohibited Books, <hi>Biblia vulgari quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque idiomate conſcripta;</hi> All Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Bible in any vulgar tongue, and in the Rules make this ſanction, <hi>Qui abſque facultate Epiſcopi aut Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris ſacra Biblia vulgari lingua habere praeſumpſerit, niſi prius Bibliis ordinario redditis peccatorum abſolutionem percipere non poterit.</hi>
                     <q>That whoever ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to have the Holy Bible in the vulgar tongue, without he have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for it a faculty or licence in Form of the Ordinary or Inquiſitor, ſhall never have abſolution of ſins
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52252:122"/>till he have returned the Bibles into the hands of his Superiours.</q> This Licence you may be ſure is very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly granted, and ſometimes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent danger is recalled, as was done by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. 1631. and not one of ten thouſand, in thoſe Countries where the Inquiſition reigns, dares ask for it, be he never ſo true a Roman Catholick, or ſo deſirous to ſee what that Book can have in it, which is ſo kept from the People, becauſe it is ſufficient to make a man of the Vulgar ſuſpect of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, if he but ſpeaks of that dangerous Book, which hath made ſo many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe Books whereof the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is judged to be good and uſeful, but that they have here and there things that border too much upon Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, after the faults are amended by the Inquiſitors or their Deputies, they may be permitted to be read. So ſaith the Eighth Rule. <hi>Libri quorum principale argumentum bonum eſt, in quibus tamen obiter quaedam inſerta ſunt quae ad haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim ſpectant, à Catholicis Theologis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitionis generalis auctoritate expurgati, concedi poſſunt.</hi>

                  <p>But what can be ſaid more for the eternal credit of the <hi>Holy Office,</hi> than what <hi>A Paramo</hi> relates, <hi>p.</hi> 138, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that about the year 1500. when many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Hereticks were ſent to the Gallies, as many immured, and many more burnt, that this ſeverity, juſt and holy as it was, yet having ſomewhat of a reſemblance to what men call cruelty, ſtaggered a little ſome ſoft-hearted Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, even Inquiſitors, and made them doubt whether that Religion and Office which reduced ſo many human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſo great miſeries, and ſhed ſo much bloud, were acceptable to God, and whether ſuch proceedings did pleaſe him; whereupon having made their humble addreſſes to the bleſſed Virgin, they demanded a ſign of her, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in this matter: and behold
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52252:125"/>Miracles appeared of all ſides; not an Image in Town, nor hardly an Officer of the Inquiſition, but were enabled to do wonders and feats, ſo great and ſo many that the ſcruple was quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and they became perſuaded that the Roman Faith and ſevere juſtice upon Hereticks are moſt dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God and all his Saints, and <hi>Franciſcus Sanctius de la Fuente</hi> Inquiſitor and Scribe was tired with writing down what miracles hapned. So that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, we may ſuppoſe, they will reſt ſatisfied, as to this inquiry.</p>
                  <p>And it is no ſmall proof that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as that of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hath great veneration for the <hi>Holy Office,</hi> when more than an hundred years ago, more than forty Inquiſitors had been made Cardinals, and five had obtained the Treble Crown of Pope, <hi>A Paramo</hi> tells us. Nay, <hi>Franciſcus Ziletus</hi> tells the Cardinal <hi>Gambara,</hi> who was of the Congregation of the Inquiſition, and makes it the ſuperlative degree of his commendations, <hi>Summis tuis meritis in ſupremum hunc ordinem &amp; cooptatus, in quo tam praeclare te geſſiſti, ut digniſſimus fueris judicatus, qui in ſacro iſto Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratu
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52252:125"/>Inquiſitionis ſederes: cujus ea eſt dignitas, meritum ac auctoritas, ut ſummi Pontifices ex eo fere deligantur.</hi>
                     <q>That his great merits having brought him him to the high honour of being a Cardinal, he had in that ſtation ſo nobly behaved himſelf, as to be raiſed to the ſacred Magiſtrature of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Inquiſition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſuch is the dignity, merit, and power, that for the moſt part the high Pontifs or Popes are choſen out of it.</q> Than which nothing upon earth can exalt higher the honour of the <hi>Holy Office.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>The Concluſion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Few Reflections on what hath been ſaid, ſhall conclude all at preſent upon this ſubject. And firſt, if thoſe of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that live amongſt us, by reading this Book, or conſulting
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52252:126"/>the Authorities I have cited, remain ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that the faith and worſhip pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to their Church, are ſuch as I have deſcribed in the two firſt Chapters, and that ſuch ſeverities, as I repreſent after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, are uſed by her againſt all that diſſent from her, then I would have them conſider, whether that part of their Religion which occaſions the breach betwixt them and us, depend not more on the Papal authority, and be not more doubtful and ſuſpicious, liable to more objections than that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtianity which we hold all together? They may believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in the Right, mankind may be abuſed, we ſee the greater part of the world are Turks and Pagans: but they cannot that have converſed with us, think that either our Lives or Doctrines are ſo abominably impious and wicked as the Papal Decrees and proceedings of the Inquiſition make them. Nay, I expect from their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, that they will believe we are in earneſt, when we proteſt that we have no other deſign in profeſſing what we do, but to pleaſe God, and make our Souls happy; that we would with our
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52252:126"/>hearts and ſouls be amongſt them, if we thought truth were there, but that after our beſt enquiries, remaining per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded we have it of our ſide, we think our ſelves obliged under peril of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to own and follow it, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we expoſe our ſelves to the greateſt extremities.</p>
               <p>But if we are miſtaken, and they are pleaſed to call us Hereticks, yet I would deſire them to conſider further, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch cruelties as their Church commands and executes againſt us, be a likely means to make us have a better opinion of it, and change our former perſuaſions? I believe many of them have too much knowledge and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to approve of thoſe violent and bloudy proceedings which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of: But then, what do they think of a Religion that doth enjoyn, practice, and commend them, as the greateſt ſervice that can be done to God? Can it be thought that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the merciful Saviour of the world allows of <hi>Croiſadoes,</hi> and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, of Dungeons, and Fetters, of Tortures and Flames, of all that can create horror in the minds of men, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52252:127"/>pain in their bodies: and that he hath left his Vicar power to make uſe of them, for to propagate and maintain his Faith.</p>
               <p>If all the Bloudy Laws and Edicts the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made againſt Chriſtians of other Communions; if all the means ſhe hath uſed to make them miſerable in the world, and to ſend them out of it; if all the Racks and Gibbets, and Inſtruments of cruelty uſed by her Inquiſitors, if all thoſe human Creatures ſhe hath with great inhumanities ſlain and burnt alive, in behalf of her Religion, and to gain and maintain her Wealth and Power; if all theſe could be ſeen altogether at once, it would be the ſaddeſt object of pity that ever eyes beheld, and an Argument which few could reſiſt, that ſure <hi>Rome</hi> is not his Church, nor holds not his Religion <hi>whoſe Kingdom was not of this world; who came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them;</hi> and who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Diſciples to be meek and lowly, to forgive Injuries, and render good for evil: and by all the methods of Patience, Charity, and Beneficence, to win mankind to the belief and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52252:127"/>profeſſion of his moſt merciful and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Here alſo thoſe of the Roman Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion may ſee why now lately the belief of a Popiſh Plot hath been ſo generally entertained amongſt us. Some of them ſeem to take it very unkindly that we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould believe any thing of it, and they wonder much that we do not ſee, how that it was an invention of the Diſſenters to involve them and us into a common ruin. But though it muſt be confeſſed, that the Diſſenters have made a very ill uſe of the diſcovery of the Plot: and that many particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Roman Communion, that proteſt of their innocence, ignorance, and abhorrence of it, are to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet it is moſt true that ſuch a Plot there may be, and warranted by all the Laws of their Church; they themſelves may have generous and merciful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, I will not deny it: But that their Religion is very cruel, as to what concerns Hereticks, they muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. When their late Councils, and Popes, and Doctors have made Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Laws, that Hereticks,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52252:128"/>Princes and all, may and muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by all means poſſible; That no Pact, no Promiſe made to them, doth any ways oblige; that whatever Roman Catholicks can ſay or do to them, in order to their Ruin, is lawful and commendable; that what in other Caſes would be Perjury, Treachery, and Murther; when uſed againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, is Juſtice, and an holy Zeal; that the Crime of Hereſie is ſo crying, ſo enormous, ſuch a High Treaſon againſt God, that all that love him, are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound to proſecute and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it; that accordingly the Church, for the propagation and defence of the Faith, hath uſed, with great ſucceſs, thoſe methods, againſt Hereticks, and where ſhe had power, erected Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Commiſſioned Officers for their puniſhment and extirpation: When we ſee this in their Books, and all the world may read it there, are we to be told there is no ſuch thing? or may we not believe that they that profeſs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at Church, would eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves to venture their lives for the extirpation of a <hi>Peſtilent Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Hereſie,</hi> as <hi>Coleman</hi> calls it.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:52252:128"/>
               <p>Whether or no, they that are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, have deſigned and attempted ſuch things as hath been depoſed by perſons from amongſt them, is not mine to determine; that belongs to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Judges: But I am confident it is eaſie to be made out more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrably, (if what I have ſaid be not ſufficient to prove it) that for what is laid to their charge, they have as ample and full encouragements and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as their Church in any caſe can give. And that ſuppoſing they had (as is ſaid) undertaken the Depoſition or Murther of his Sacred Majeſty, and others that ſtood in their way, in order to bring in the Roman Catholick Faith, it was only the executing the often repeated Sentences of the Sovereign Tribunal of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt ſuch as are guilty of the unpardonable crime of Heretical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: Having alſo the ſame power, as well to forſwear and deny, as to act any of the Premiſes.</p>
               <p>I am a Witneſs againſt none of them, and for ought I know they may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: but it is proved that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is guilty, and would countenance and reward the deſtruction of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52252:129"/>however effected. And then, it ſhould not be much wondred at, that we think it poſſible ſome of them may be led by the Principles of their Church: and in compliance with the Sacred San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Decrees of it might, conſult and contrive how to do juſtice upon us; for ſo they call in the Roman Language, what in ours is Treaſon, Murther, and Cruelty.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits are charged with all theſe, and there are commonly loud clamours againſt them, as if they alone were the cauſe of our miſeries and dangers. But I ſay, though they may be more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Papacy, and more obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to it, obliged by their fourth Vow, yet the Inquiſition was erected, and had done great execution, long before their Order appeared: and moſt of thoſe Canons, Bulls, and Decretals, that devote us to deſtruction, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, publiſhed, and executed, before their name was heard of in the world: ſo that, if they out-do others in being more active and more fierce againſt us, this is all can be ſaid; that they are moſt true to their Church and Religion, and beſt deſerve the name
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52252:129"/>of down-right Roman Catholicks.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Here our Neighbours of the Roman Communion, may ſee, why we alſo of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are ſo affraid of them and their Religion. They may obſerve that we joyn not with popular factions; that we do not inſtigate the Vulgar to be violent againſt them; that in our converſe with them, they find us courteous and kind; and that we declared, when there was danger on all hands to do it, that if God, after that moſt excellent Prince under whom we live, ſhould ſuffer another of their Perſuaſion to ſucceed, we would own and obey him; and whatever dangers and perſecutions we might be expoſed to, be dutiful and loyal, as becomes true Chriſtians. But then we know, that their Religion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth them to deal very ill by us, that are declared Hereticks: and we know not how far they may think themſelves bound to comply with thoſe obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We know that a Prince of their Communion would have the ſame, and ſtronger ties upon him, to endeavour the extirpation of Hereſie: and we know not how far the preſſing impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52252:130"/>of the Roman Court and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or the fear of undergoing the Fate of the two <hi>Henries</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> might prevail upon him. We know that what intereſt they have had here at Court, hath been uſed for the depreſſing of our Clergy; for the weakening the ſettlement and Conſtitution of our Church; for the encouraging of the Sectaries againſt us; for bringing our Peace and eſtabliſhed Religion into confuſion and contempt: and that, that we are not yet ruined, is altogether owing to Gods infinite Mercy, and to the Kings Goodneſs. And we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded upon very good grounds, that if the change were brought about, and their Church had here that Power, which it hath whereever their Religion is uppermoſt, that we ſhould be in a moſt miſerable condition; forced to abjure what in our Conſcience we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be the true and ſaving Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our dear Saviour; forced to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and practiſe what we believe to be altogether falſe and ſuperſtitious; or forced by the proſecution of thoſe Laws againſt Hereticks, which they count Sacred and Divine, to be poor,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52252:130"/>deſpiſed and perſecuted, or to lie in Goals, and burn at the Stake.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe things we have had occaſion to know, and the others we have very juſt cauſe to fear: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though we would not do any thing unjuſt or illegal to preſerve our ſelves, yet we would be very glad to be more ſecure, and would have been very well ſatisfied, and very thankful if it had pleaſed the late Parliaments, to have made Laws, according to his Majeſties moſt gracious offer, for the limiting the power of a Popiſh Succeſſor, if ever ſuch a one there ſhould be, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Proteſtant hands, for the preſerving the Eſtabliſhed Religion without deſtroying Monarchy. I ſay, for this we would have bleſſed God, and the King, and our Repreſentatives, had they thought fit to have done that for us: and we would have thought our ſelves much ſafer and happier than we are, as they have left us, expoſed naked to all that may happen.</p>
               <p>Our Conſciences and Perſuaſions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us, by Reaſon, and Argument,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52252:131"/>and all Chriſtian and Equitable ways, to oppoſe the Papal Religion, which we believe to be highly diſhonourable to God, and prejudicial to the ſouls of men: therefore though we rail not, and make not ſuch out-cries, as ſome are apt to do, yet by ſerious Writings and Diſcourſes, we think our ſelves bound to confirm our people in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>We are not apt to ſtart at Bugbears and ſhadows, nor to fill the heads of the People with Pannick and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs terrours: yet we have very ſad apprehenſions of what we muſt be, if we ſhould come under the Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> and will do what juſtly we may, to preſerve our Religion and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and prevent what to us appears, upon all accounts, moſt dreadful and terrible, the Roman Catholick Faith and Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>As for them that are Proteſtants, I deſire them to obſerve, how afflicted hath been the Condition of millions of our Chriſtian Brethren, whilſt they were expoſed to thoſe ſevere Roman Tribunals, of which I have given ſome account: and to think with pity, on
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52252:131"/>the great oppreſſions and ſufferings of many, who ſtill in many Countries, groan under Papal Tyranny. And then to pay their hearty thanks and acknowledgments to God, for that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, thoſe immunities, and thoſe great bleſſings we enjoy, by living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules of that pure and holy Reformed Religion which is here eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and profeſſed among us; by heartily joyning with the Church, in offering up with devout affections thoſe Prayers and Praiſes, and acceptable Services, wherewith ſhe worſhips God daily; and by having a Reverend eſteem of thoſe Orders and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which our Reformers eſtabliſhed in oppoſition to Popery, and which coſt many of them their lives.</p>
               <p>We ſee how great is our danger from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhe hath made Sacred and Religious the moſt ſevere and unnatural means that can be uſed to deſtroy us: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt expect no quarter from them that live in ſubjection to her, who the more zealous and devout they are, the more implacable and fierce they are againſt us, being perſuaded that by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52252:132"/>the puniſhing and extirpating Hereſie, they mightily endear themſelves to the whole Court of Heaven, and merit the higheſt rewards. We ſee further that, though there were not that danger, yet we are in duty bound to avoid and oppoſe the Romiſh Religion, which greatly wrongs the truth and honour of our God and Saviour, and puts men out of the plain Primitive and ſafe way to Heaven: and to endeavour the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and advancement of true Chriſtianity, as we have it, by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and the great ſufferings of our Predeceſſors, reſtored to us.</p>
               <p>Therefore, let me deſire the good people among us, who really have a love and value for the true Proteſtant Religion, to conſider, that Popery is not what every one diſlikes, or is pleaſed to call ſo. We have a ſort of men, who brand with as black names the innocent Ceremonies, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Decencies, and Orders of our Church, as they can do the worſt Corruptions in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> nay, and all men that make Conſcience of being conformable to the Laws un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we live, and that are Friends
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52252:132"/>to the Government Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, are preſently Popiſhly affected. This palpably appears to be a deſign of them who once before, under the ſame pretence, did ruin King and Church, and enſlave their Country; for theſe very men upon occaſion, when it is to ſerve a turn, or to get an Office, will freely Conform, even receive the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament in our way, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally they had never done before, but much ſlighted and ſpoken againſt: and our preſent Conſtitutions in Church and State, are ſo far from favouring Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, that they were made in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, and have effectually kept it out above a hundred years: and it is now clear by the Depoſitions upon Oath of the chief Diſcoverers of the Plot, and by <hi>Colemans</hi> Letters, that Popery is to be brought in (if it can be) by means of theſe very Sectaries, who now would run us down for Papiſts, and by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and abrogating thoſe Laws and that Eſtabliſhment, which many Diſſenters clamour at, and fain would pull down.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people the Snare that is ſet for us;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52252:133"/>and to induce them, as good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and good Subjects, to help to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defend the Eſtabliſhed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the profeſſion whereof they may be as godly, and as vertuous and good, as it is poſſible for men to be here below, in our ſtate of imperfection. Herein lies our Safety as well as our Duty, that there may be a National Conſtitution, and we may be united together in Religious Bonds, under our lawful Governours. It adds much to the ſtrength and credit of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Members thereof are governable, or at leaſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, and kept under one Rule: whereas it brings diſgrace, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ruin to the Reformation, to have ſome that would be called Proteſtants, perpetually contending with their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, endeavouring to ſhake off their Yoke, always objecting and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling againſt Laws and publick Orders, and entertaining ſuch Principles of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſm, as divides them into Sects and Factions. This is ſo contrary to the common notion of true Godlineſs, and to that meek ſpirit which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſo much recommends, that I hope
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52252:133"/>God will open the eyes of ſuch as truly fear him, and have no ill deſigns, and make them ſee how much it is for the intereſt of their preſent and future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to joyn with our Church, to defend it, and live in it like good Chriſtians, and loyal Subjects, as all the ties of Religion and Conſcience ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to do.</p>
               <p>They that now aim at a change, brought one about, within theſe forty years, moſt fatal and infamous to the Proteſtant cauſe; and the good people were infinitely cheated, and paid very dear for the overturning that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Church and State, under which they might have lived very innocent, and very happy, in compariſon to what they did, in that bloudy and unnatural War and Uſurpation, which I hope is not yet forgot: but will ever be a caution to all good men amongſt us, to endeavour for the preſervation of our peace and ſettlement. That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a truly Chriſtian Religion as we have, and ſo gracious a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we may not uſe our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for a cloak of Maliciouſneſs: nor abuſe by a froward and unthankful
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52252:134"/>humour, thoſe great and ſpecial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we enjoy: nor provoke God to bring upon us and our Land the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and Cruelties of the Roman Church. From which, good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, and all thy Servants for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
